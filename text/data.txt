facing trauma
ne does not have be a combat soldier or visit a refugee camp in syria or the
congo to encounter trauma trauma happens to us our friends our
families and our neighbors research by the centers for disease control and
prevention has shown that one in five americans was sexually molested as a
child one in four was beaten by a parent to the point of a mark being left on
their body and one in three couples engages in physical violence a quarter of
us grew up with alcoholic relatives and one out of eight witnessed their mother
being beaten or hit 
1
as human beings we belong to an extremely resilient species since time
immemorial we have rebounded from our relentless wars countless disasters
 both natural and man made and the violence and betrayal in our own lives 
but traumatic experiences do leave traces whether on a large scale on our
histories and cultures or close to home on our families with dark secrets being
imperceptibly passed down through generations they also leave traces on our
minds and emotions on our capacity for joy and intimacy and even on our
biology and immune systems 
trauma affects not only those who are directly exposed to it but also those
around them soldiers returning home from combat may frighten their families
with their rages and emotional absence the wives of men who suffer from
ptsd tend to become depressed and the children of depressed mothers are at
risk of growing up insecure and anxious having been exposed to family
violence as a child often makes it difficult to establish stable trusting
relationships as an adult 
trauma by definition is unbearable and intolerable most rape victims 
combat soldiers and children who have been molested become so upset when

they think about what they experienced that they try to push it out of their minds 
trying to act as if nothing happened and move on it takes tremendous energy to
keep functioning while carrying the memory of terror and the shame of utter
weakness and vulnerability 
while we all want to move beyond trauma the part of our brain that is
devoted to ensuring our survival deep below our rational brain is not very good
at denial long after a traumatic experience is over it may be reactivated at the
slightest hint of danger and mobilize disturbed brain circuits and secrete massive
amounts of stress hormones this precipitates unpleasant emotions intense
physical sensations and impulsive and aggressive actions these posttraumatic
reactions feel incomprehensible and overwhelming feeling out of control 
survivors of trauma often begin to fear that they are damaged to the core and
beyond redemption 
 
the first time i remember being drawn to study medicine was at a summer camp
when i was about fourteen years old my cousin michael kept me up all night
explaining the intricacies of how kidneys work how they secrete the body s
waste materials and then reabsorb the chemicals that keep the system in balance 
i was riveted by his account of the miraculous way the body functions later 
during every stage of my medical training whether i was studying surgery 
cardiology or pediatrics it was obvious to me that the key to healing was
understanding how the human organism works when i began my psychiatry
rotation however i was struck by the contrast between the incredible
complexity of the mind and the ways that we human beings are connected and
attached to one another and how little psychiatrists knew about the origins of the
problems they were treating would it be possible one day to know as much
about brains minds and love as we do about the other systems that make up our
organism 
we are obviously still years from attaining that sort of detailed
understanding but the birth of three new branches of science has led to an
explosion of knowledge about the effects of psychological trauma abuse and
neglect those new disciplines are neuroscience the study of how the brain
supports mental processes developmental psychopathology the study of the
impact of adverse experiences on the development of mind and brain and
interpersonal neurobiology the study of how our behavior influences the

emotions biology and mind sets of those around us 
research from these new disciplines has revealed that trauma produces
actual physiological changes including a recalibration of the brain s alarm
system an increase in stress hormone activity and alterations in the system that
filters relevant information from irrelevant we now know that trauma
compromises the brain area that communicates the physical embodied feeling of
being alive these changes explain why traumatized individuals become
hypervigilant to threat at the expense of spontaneously engaging in their day to 
day lives they also help us understand why traumatized people so often keep
repeating the same problems and have such trouble learning from experience 
we now know that their behaviors are not the result of moral failings or signs of
lack of willpower or bad character they are caused by actual changes in the
brain 
this vast increase in our knowledge about the basic processes that underlie
trauma has also opened up new possibilities to palliate or even reverse the
damage we can now develop methods and experiences that utilize the brain s
own natural neuroplasticity to help survivors feel fully alive in the present and
move on with their lives there are fundamentally three avenues 1 top down 
by talking re connecting with others and allowing ourselves to know and
understand what is going on with us while processing the memories of the
trauma 2 by taking medicines that shut down inappropriate alarm reactions or
by utilizing other technologies that change the way the brain organizes
information and 3 bottom up by allowing the body to have experiences that
deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness rage or collapse that result
from trauma which one of these is best for any particular survivor is an
empirical question most people i have worked with require a combination 
this has been my life s work in this effort i have been supported by my
colleagues and students at the trauma center which i founded thirty years ago 
together we have treated thousands of traumatized children and adults victims
of child abuse natural disasters wars accidents and human trafficking people
who have suffered assaults by intimates and strangers we have a long tradition
of discussing all our patients in great depth at weekly treatment team meetings
and carefully tracking how well different forms of treatment work for particular
individuals 
our principal mission has always been to take care of the children and adults
who have come to us for treatment but from the very beginning we also have
dedicated ourselves to conducting research to explore the effects of traumatic

stress on different populations and to determine what treatments work for whom 
we have been supported by research grants from the national institute of mental
health the national center for complementary and alternative medicine the
centers for disease control and a number of private foundations to study the
efficacy of many different forms of treatment from medications to talking yoga 
emdr theater and neurofeedback 
the challenge is how can people gain control over the residues of past
trauma and return to being masters of their own ship talking understanding 
and human connections help and drugs can dampen hyperactive alarm systems 
but we will also see that the imprints from the past can be transformed by
having physical experiences that directly contradict the helplessness rage and
collapse that are part of trauma and thereby regaining self mastery i have no
preferred treatment modality as no single approach fits everybody but i practice
all the forms of treatment that i discuss in this book each one of them can
produce profound changes depending on the nature of the particular problem
and the makeup of the individual person 
i wrote this book to serve as both a guide and an invitation an invitation to
dedicate ourselves to facing the reality of trauma to explore how best to treat it 
and to commit ourselves as a society to using every means we have to prevent
it

lessons from vietnam veterans
i became what i am today at the age of twelve on a frigid overcast day
in the winter of 1975 that was a long time ago but it s wrong what
they say about the past looking back now i realize i have been
peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty six years

 jessica stern 
denial a memoir of terror
he tuesday after the fourth of july weekend 1978 was my first day as a
staff psychiatrist at the boston veterans administration clinic as i was
hanging a reproduction of my favorite breughel painting the blind leading
the blind on the wall of my new office i heard a commotion in the reception
area down the hall a moment later a large disheveled man in a stained three 
piece suit carrying a copy of 
soldier of fortune
 magazine under his arm burst
through my door he was so agitated and so clearly hungover that i wondered
how i could possibly help this hulking man i asked him to take a seat and tell
me what i could do for him 
his name was tom ten years earlier he had been in the marines doing his
service in vietnam he had spent the holiday weekend holed up in his

downtown boston law office drinking and looking at old photographs rather
than with his family he knew from previous years experience that the noise the
fireworks the heat and the picnic in his sister s backyard against the backdrop
of dense early summer foliage all of which reminded him of vietnam would
drive him crazy when he got upset he was afraid to be around his family
because he behaved like a monster with his wife and two young boys the noise
of his kids made him so agitated that he would storm out of the house to keep
himself from hurting them only drinking himself into oblivion or riding his
harley davidson at dangerously high speeds helped him to calm down 
nighttime offered no relief his sleep was constantly interrupted by
nightmares about an ambush in a rice paddy back in nam in which all the
members of his platoon were killed or wounded he also had terrifying
flashbacks in which he saw dead vietnamese children the nightmares were so
horrible that he dreaded falling asleep and he often stayed up for most of the
night drinking in the morning his wife would find him passed out on the living
room couch and she and the boys had to tiptoe around him while she made them
breakfast before taking them to school 
filling me in on his background tom said that he had graduated from high
school in 1965 the valedictorian of his class in line with his family tradition of
military service he enlisted in the marine corps immediately after graduation 
his father had served in world war ii in general patton s army and tom never
questioned his father s expectations athletic intelligent and an obvious leader 
tom felt powerful and effective after finishing basic training a member of a
team that was prepared for just about anything in vietnam he quickly became a
platoon leader in charge of eight other marines surviving slogging through the
mud while being strafed by machine gun fire can leave people feeling pretty
good about themselves and their comrades 
at the end of his tour of duty tom was honorably discharged and all he
wanted was to put vietnam behind him outwardly that s exactly what he did 
he attended college on the gi bill graduated from law school married his high
school sweetheart and had two sons tom was upset by how difficult it was to
feel any real affection for his wife even though her letters had kept him alive in
the madness of the jungle tom went through the motions of living a normal life 
hoping that by faking it he would learn to become his old self again he now had
a thriving law practice and a picture perfect family but he sensed he wasn t
normal he felt dead inside 
although tom was the first veteran i had ever encountered on a professional

basis many aspects of his story were familiar to me i grew up in postwar
holland playing in bombed out buildings the son of a man who had been such
an outspoken opponent of the nazis that he had been sent to an internment camp 
my father never talked about his war experiences but he was given to outbursts
of explosive rage that stunned me as a little boy how could the man i heard
quietly going down the stairs every morning to pray and read the bible while the
rest of the family slept have such a terrifying temper how could someone
whose life was devoted to the pursuit of social justice be so filled with anger i
witnessed the same puzzling behavior in my uncle who had been captured by
the japanese in the dutch east indies now indonesia and sent as a slave laborer
to burma where he worked on the famous bridge over the river kwai he also
rarely mentioned the war and he too often erupted into uncontrollable rages 
as i listened to tom i wondered if my uncle and my father had had
nightmares and flashbacks if they too had felt disconnected from their loved
ones and unable to find any real pleasure in their lives somewhere in the back
of my mind there must also have been my memories of my frightened and
often frightening mother whose own childhood trauma was sometimes alluded
to and i now believe was frequently reenacted she had the unnerving habit of
fainting when i asked her what her life was like as a little girl and then blaming
me for making her so upset 
reassured by my obvious interest tom settled down to tell me just how
scared and confused he was he was afraid that he was becoming just like his
father who was always angry and rarely talked with his children except to
compare them unfavorably with his comrades who had lost their lives around
christmas 1944 during the battle of the bulge 
as the session was drawing to a close i did what doctors typically do i
focused on the one part of tom s story that i thought i understood his
nightmares as a medical student i had worked in a sleep laboratory observing
people s sleep dream cycles and had assisted in writing some articles about
nightmares i had also participated in some early research on the beneficial
effects of the psychoactive drugs that were just coming into use in the 1970s so 
while i lacked a true grasp of the scope of tom s problems the nightmares were
something i could relate to and as an enthusiastic believer in better living
through chemistry i prescribed a drug that we had found to be effective in
reducing the incidence and severity of nightmares i scheduled tom for a follow 
up visit two weeks later 
when he returned for his appointment i eagerly asked tom how the

medicines had worked he told me he hadn t taken any of the pills trying to
conceal my irritation i asked him why i realized that if i take the pills and the
nightmares go away he replied i will have abandoned my friends and their
deaths will have been in vain i need to be a living memorial to my friends who
died in vietnam 
i was stunned tom s loyalty to the dead was keeping him from living his
own life just as his father s devotion to his friends had kept him from living 
both father s and son s experiences on the battlefield had rendered the rest of
their lives irrelevant how had that happened and what could we do about it 
that morning i realized i would probably spend the rest of my professional life
trying to unravel the mysteries of trauma how do horrific experiences cause
people to become hopelessly stuck in the past what happens in people s minds
and brains that keeps them frozen trapped in a place they desperately wish to
escape why did this man s war not come to an end in february 1969 when his
parents embraced him at boston s logan international airport after his long
flight back from da nang 
tom s need to live out his life as a memorial to his comrades taught me that
he was suffering from a condition much more complex than simply having bad
memories or damaged brain chemistry or altered fear circuits in the brain 
before the ambush in the rice paddy tom had been a devoted and loyal friend 
someone who enjoyed life with many interests and pleasures in one terrifying
moment trauma had transformed everything 
during my time at the va i got to know many men who responded similarly 
faced with even minor frustrations our veterans often flew instantly into
extreme rages the public areas of the clinic were pockmarked with the impacts
of their fists on the drywall and security was kept constantly busy protecting
claims agents and receptionists from enraged veterans of course their behavior
scared us but i also was intrigued 
at home my wife and i were coping with similar problems in our toddlers 
who regularly threw temper tantrums when told to eat their spinach or to put on
warm socks why was it then that i was utterly unconcerned about my kids 
immature behavior but deeply worried by what was going on with the vets aside
from their size of course which gave them the potential to inflict much more
harm than my two footers at home the reason was that i felt perfectly
confident that with proper care my kids would gradually learn to deal with
frustrations and disappointments but i was skeptical that i would be able to help
my veterans reacquire the skills of self control and self regulation that they had

lost in the war 
unfortunately nothing in my psychiatric training had prepared me to deal
with any of the challenges that tom and his fellow veterans presented i went
down to the medical library to look for books on war neurosis shell shock battle
fatigue or any other term or diagnosis i could think of that might shed light on
my patients to my surprise the library at the va didn t have a single book about
any of these conditions five years after the last american soldier left vietnam 
the issue of wartime trauma was still not on anybody s agenda finally in the
countway library at harvard medical school i discovered 
the traumatic
neuroses of war
 which had been published in 1941 by a psychiatrist named
abram kardiner it described kardiner s observations of world war i veterans
and had been released in anticipation of the flood of shell shocked soldiers
expected to be casualties of world war ii 
1
kardiner reported the same phenomena i was seeing after the war his
patients were overtaken by a sense of futility they became withdrawn and
detached even if they had functioned well before what kardiner called
 traumatic neuroses today we call posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd 
kardiner noted that sufferers from traumatic neuroses develop a chronic
vigilance for and sensitivity to threat his summation especially caught my eye 
 the nucleus of the neurosis is a physioneurosis 
2
 in other words posttraumatic
stress isn t all in one s head as some people supposed but has a physiological
basis kardiner understood even then that the symptoms have their origin in the
entire body s response to the original trauma 
kardiner s description corroborated my own observations which was
reassuring but it provided me with little guidance on how to help the veterans 
the lack of literature on the topic was a handicap but my great teacher elvin
semrad had taught us to be skeptical about textbooks we had only one real
textbook he said our patients we should trust only what we could learn from
them and from our own experience this sounds so simple but even as semrad
pushed us to rely upon self knowledge he also warned us how difficult that
process really is since human beings are experts in wishful thinking and
obscuring the truth i remember him saying the greatest sources of our
suffering are the lies we tell ourselves working at the va i soon discovered
how excruciating it can be to face reality this was true both for my patients and
for myself 
we don t really want to know what soldiers go through in combat we do
not really want to know how many children are being molested and abused in

our own society or how many couples almost a third as it turns out engage in
violence at some point during their relationship we want to think of families as
safe havens in a heartless world and of our own country as populated by
enlightened civilized people we prefer to believe that cruelty occurs only in
faraway places like darfur or the congo it is hard enough for observers to bear
witness to pain is it any wonder then that the traumatized individuals
themselves cannot tolerate remembering it and that they often resort to using
drugs alcohol or self mutilation to block out their unbearable knowledge 
tom and his fellow veterans became my first teachers in my quest to
understand how lives are shattered by overwhelming experiences and in
figuring out how to enable them to feel fully alive again 
trauma and the loss of self
the first study i did at the va started with systematically asking veterans what
had happened to them in vietnam i wanted to know what had pushed them over
the brink and why some had broken down as a result of that experience while
others had been able to go on with their lives 
3
 most of the men i interviewed
had gone to war feeling well prepared drawn close by the rigors of basic
training and the shared danger they exchanged pictures of their families and
girlfriends they put up with one another s flaws and they were prepared to risk
their lives for their friends most of them confided their dark secrets to a buddy 
and some went so far as to share each other s shirts and socks 
many of the men had friendships similar to tom s with alex tom met
alex an italian guy from malden massachusetts on his first day in country and
they instantly became close friends they drove their jeep together listened to
the same music and read each other s letters from home they got drunk
together and chased the same vietnamese bar girls 
after about three months in country tom led his squad on a foot patrol
through a rice paddy just before sunset suddenly a hail of gunfire spurted from
the green wall of the surrounding jungle hitting the men around him one by one 
tom told me how he had looked on in helpless horror as all the members of his
platoon were killed or wounded in a matter of seconds he would never get one
image out of his mind the back of alex s head as he lay facedown in the rice
paddy his feet in the air tom wept as he recalled he was the only real friend i
ever had afterward at night tom continued to hear the screams of his men

and to see their bodies falling into the water any sounds smells or images that
reminded him of the ambush like the popping of firecrackers on the fourth of
july made him feel just as paralyzed terrified and enraged as he had the day
the helicopter evacuated him from the rice paddy 
maybe even worse for tom than the recurrent flashbacks of the ambush was
the memory of what happened afterward i could easily imagine how tom s rage
about his friend s death had led to the calamity that followed it took him months
of dealing with his paralyzing shame before he could tell me about it since time
immemorial veterans like achilles in homer s 
iliad
 have responded to the
death of their comrades with unspeakable acts of revenge the day after the
ambush tom went into a frenzy to a neighboring village killing children 
shooting an innocent farmer and raping a vietnamese woman after that it
became truly impossible for him to go home again in any meaningful way how
can you face your sweetheart and tell her that you brutally raped a woman just
like her or watch your son take his first step when you are reminded of the child
you murdered tom experienced the death of alex as if part of himself had been
forever destroyed the part that was good and honorable and trustworthy 
trauma whether it is the result of something done to you or something you
yourself have done almost always makes it difficult to engage in intimate
relationships after you have experienced something so unspeakable how do
you learn to trust yourself or anyone else again or conversely how can you
surrender to an intimate relationship after you have been brutally violated 
tom kept showing up faithfully for his appointments as i had become for
him a lifeline the father he d never had an alex who had survived the ambush 
it takes enormous trust and courage to allow yourself to remember one of the
hardest things for traumatized people is to confront their shame about the way
they behaved during a traumatic episode whether it is objectively warranted as
in the commission of atrocities or not as in the case of a child who tries to
placate her abuser one of the first people to write about this phenomenon was
sarah haley who occupied an office next to mine at the va clinic in an article
entitled when the patient reports atrocities 
4
 which became a major impetus
for the ultimate creation of the ptsd diagnosis she discussed the well nigh
intolerable difficulty of talking about and listening to the horrendous acts that
are often committed by soldiers in the course of their war experiences it s hard
enough to face the suffering that has been inflicted by others but deep down
many traumatized people are even more haunted by the shame they feel about
what they themselves did or did not do under the circumstances they despise

themselves for how terrified dependent excited or enraged they felt 
in later years i encountered a similar phenomenon in victims of child abuse 
most of them suffer from agonizing shame about the actions they took to survive
and maintain a connection with the person who abused them this was
particularly true if the abuser was someone close to the child someone the child
depended on as is so often the case the result can be confusion about whether
one was a victim or a willing participant which in turn leads to bewilderment
about the difference between love and terror pain and pleasure we will return to
this dilemma throughout this book 
numbing
maybe the worst of tom s symptoms was that he felt emotionally numb he
desperately wanted to love his family but he just couldn t evoke any deep
feelings for them he felt emotionally distant from everybody as though his
heart were frozen and he were living behind a glass wall that numbness
extended to himself as well he could not really feel anything except for his
momentary rages and his shame he described how he hardly recognized himself
when he looked in the mirror to shave when he heard himself arguing a case in
court he would observe himself from a distance and wonder how this guy who
happened to look and talk like him was able to make such cogent arguments 
when he won a case he pretended to be gratified and when he lost it was as
though he had seen it coming and was resigned to the defeat even before it
happened despite the fact that he was a very effective lawyer he always felt as
though he were floating in space lacking any sense of purpose or direction 
the only thing that occasionally relieved this feeling of aimlessness was
intense involvement in a particular case during the course of our treatment tom
had to defend a mobster on a murder charge for the duration of that trial he was
totally absorbed in devising a strategy for winning the case and there were many
occasions on which he stayed up all night to immerse himself in something that
actually excited him it was like being in combat he said he felt fully alive 
and nothing else mattered the moment tom won that case however he lost his
energy and sense of purpose the nightmares returned as did his rage attacks 
so intensely that he had to move into a motel to ensure that he would not harm
his wife or children but being alone too was terrifying because the demons of
the war returned in full force tom tried to stay busy working drinking and
drugging doing anything to avoid confronting his demons 

he kept thumbing through 
soldier of fortune 
 fantasizing about enlisting as
a mercenary in one of the many regional wars then raging in africa that spring
he took out his harley and roared up the kancamagus highway in new
hampshire the vibrations speed and danger of that ride helped him pull
himself back together to the point that he was able to leave his motel room and
return to his family 
the reorganization of perception
another study i conducted at the va started out as research about nightmares but
ended up exploring how trauma changes people s perceptions and imagination 
bill a former medic who had seen heavy action in vietnam a decade earlier was
the first person enrolled in my nightmare study after his discharge he had
enrolled in a theological seminary and had been assigned to his first parish in a
congregational church in a boston suburb he was doing fine until he and his
wife had their first child soon after the baby s birth his wife a nurse had gone
back to work while he remained at home working on his weekly sermon and
other parish duties and taking care of their newborn on the very first day he was
left alone with the baby it began to cry and he found himself suddenly flooded
with unbearable images of dying children in vietnam 
bill had to call his wife to take over child care and came to the va in a
panic he described how he kept hearing the sounds of babies crying and seeing
images of burned and bloody children s faces my medical colleagues thought
that he must surely be psychotic because the textbooks of the time said that
auditory and visual hallucinations were symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia 
the same texts that provided this diagnosis also supplied a cause bill s
psychosis was probably triggered by his feeling displaced in his wife s affections
by their new baby 
as i arrived at the intake office that day i saw bill surrounded by worried
doctors who were preparing to inject him with a powerful antipsychotic drug and
ship him off to a locked ward they described his symptoms and asked my
opinion having worked in a previous job on a ward specializing in the treatment
of schizophrenics i was intrigued something about the diagnosis didn t sound
right i asked bill if i could talk with him and after hearing his story i
unwittingly paraphrased something sigmund freud had said about trauma in
1895 i think this man is suffering from memories i told bill that i would try
to help him and after offering him some medications to control his panic asked

if he would be willing to come back a few days later to participate in my
nightmare study 
5
 he agreed 
as part of that study we gave our participants a rorschach test 
6
 unlike tests
that require answers to straightforward questions responses to the rorschach are
almost impossible to fake the rorschach provides us with a unique way to
observe how people construct a mental image from what is basically a
meaningless stimulus a blot of ink because humans are meaning making
creatures we have a tendency to create some sort of image or story out of those
inkblots just as we do when we lie in a meadow on a beautiful summer day and
see images in the clouds floating high above what people make out of these
blots can tell us a lot about how their minds work 
on seeing the second card of the rorschach test bill exclaimed in horror 
 this is that child that i saw being blown up in vietnam in the middle you see
the charred flesh the wounds and the blood is spurting out all over panting
and with sweat beading on his forehead he was in a panic similar to the one that
had initially brought him to the va clinic although i had heard veterans
describing their flashbacks this was the first time i actually witnessed one in
that very moment in my office bill was obviously seeing the same images 
smelling the same smells and feeling the same physical sensations he had felt
during the original event ten years after helplessly holding a dying baby in his
arms bill was reliving the trauma in response to an inkblot 
experiencing bill s flashback firsthand in my office helped me realize the
agony that regularly visited the veterans i was trying to treat and helped me
appreciate again how critical it was to find a solution the traumatic event itself 
however horrendous had a beginning a middle and an end but i now saw that
flashbacks could be even worse you never know when you will be assaulted by
them again and you have no way of telling when they will stop it took me years
to learn how to effectively treat flashbacks and in this process bill turned out to
be one of my most important mentors 
when we gave the rorschach test to twenty one additional veterans the
response was consistent sixteen of them on seeing the second card reacted as
if they were experiencing a wartime trauma the second rorschach card is the
first card that contains color and often elicits so called color shock in response 
the veterans interpreted this card with descriptions like these are the bowels of
my friend jim after a mortar shell ripped him open and this is the neck of my
friend danny after his head was blown off by a shell while we were eating
lunch none of them mentioned dancing monks fluttering butterflies men on

motorcycles or any of the other ordinary sometimes whimsical images that most
people see 
while the majority of the veterans were greatly upset by what they saw the
reactions of the remaining five were even more alarming they simply went
blank this is nothing one observed just a bunch of ink they were right of
course but the normal human response to ambiguous stimuli is to use our
imagination to read something into them 
we learned from these rorschach tests that traumatized people have a
tendency to superimpose their trauma on everything around them and have
trouble deciphering whatever is going on around them there appeared to be
little in between we also learned that trauma affects the imagination the five
men who saw nothing in the blots had lost the capacity to let their minds play 
but so too had the other sixteen men for in viewing scenes from the past in
those blots they were not displaying the mental flexibility that is the hallmark of
imagination they simply kept replaying an old reel 
imagination is absolutely critical to the quality of our lives our imagination
enables us to leave our routine everyday existence by fantasizing about travel 
food sex falling in love or having the last word all the things that make life
interesting imagination gives us the opportunity to envision new possibilities 
it is an essential launchpad for making our hopes come true it fires our
creativity relieves our boredom alleviates our pain enhances our pleasure and
enriches our most intimate relationships when people are compulsively and
constantly pulled back into the past to the last time they felt intense involvement
and deep emotions they suffer from a failure of imagination a loss of the mental
flexibility without imagination there is no hope no chance to envision a better
future no place to go no goal to reach 
the rorschach tests also taught us that traumatized people look at the world
in a fundamentally different way from other people for most of us a man
coming down the street is just someone taking a walk a rape victim however 
may see a person who is about to molest her and go into a panic a stern
schoolteacher may be an intimidating presence to an average kid but for a child
whose stepfather beats him up she may represent a torturer and precipitate a
rage attack or a terrified cowering in the corner 
stuck in trauma
our clinic was inundated with veterans seeking psychiatric help however 

because of an acute shortage of qualified doctors all we could do was put most
of them on a waiting list even as they continued brutalizing themselves and their
families we began seeing a sharp increase in arrests of veterans for violent
offenses and drunken brawls as well as an alarming number of suicides i
received permission to start a group for young vietnam veterans to serve as a
sort of holding tank until real therapy could start 
at the opening session for a group of former marines the first man to speak
flatly declared i do not want to talk about the war i replied that the members
could discuss anything they wanted after half an hour of excruciating silence 
one veteran finally started to talk about his helicopter crash to my amazement
the rest immediately came to life speaking with great intensity about their
traumatic experiences all of them returned the following week and the week
after in the group they found resonance and meaning in what had previously
been only sensations of terror and emptiness they felt a renewed sense of the
comradeship that had been so vital to their war experience they insisted that i
had to be part of their newfound unit and gave me a marine captain s uniform
for my birthday in retrospect that gesture revealed part of the problem you
were either in or out you either belonged to the unit or you were nobody after
trauma the world becomes sharply divided between those who know and those
who don t people who have not shared the traumatic experience cannot be
trusted because they can t understand it sadly this often includes spouses 
children and co workers 
later i led another group this time for veterans of patton s army men now
well into their seventies all old enough to be my father we met on monday
mornings at eight o clock in boston winter snowstorms occasionally paralyze
the public transit system but to my amazement all of them showed up even
during blizzards some of them trudging several miles through the snow to reach
the va clinic for christmas they gave me a 1940s gi issue wristwatch as had
been the case with my group of marines i could not be their doctor unless they
made me one of them 
moving as these experiences were the limits of group therapy became clear
when i urged the men to talk about the issues they confronted in their daily lives 
their relationships with their wives children girlfriends and family dealing
with their bosses and finding satisfaction in their work their heavy use of
alcohol their typical response was to balk and resist and instead recount yet
again how they had plunged a dagger through the heart of a german soldier in
the h rtgen forest or how their helicopter had been shot down in the jungles of

vietnam 
whether the trauma had occurred ten years in the past or more than forty 
my patients could not bridge the gap between their wartime experiences and
their current lives somehow the very event that caused them so much pain had
also become their sole source of meaning they felt fully alive only when they
were revisiting their traumatic past 
diagnosing posttraumatic stress
in those early days at the va we labeled our veterans with all sorts of diagnoses
 alcoholism substance abuse depression mood disorder even schizophrenia
 and we tried every treatment in our textbooks but for all our efforts it became
clear that we were actually accomplishing very little the powerful drugs we
prescribed often left the men in such a fog that they could barely function when
we encouraged them to talk about the precise details of a traumatic event we
often inadvertently triggered a full blown flashback rather than helping them
resolve the issue many of them dropped out of treatment because we were not
only failing to help but also sometimes making things worse 
a turning point arrived in 1980 when a group of vietnam veterans aided by
the new york psychoanalysts chaim shatan and robert j lifton successfully
lobbied the american psychiatric association to create a new diagnosis 
posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd which described a cluster of symptoms
that was common to a greater or lesser extent to all of our veterans 
systematically identifying the symptoms and grouping them together into a
disorder finally gave a name to the suffering of people who were overwhelmed
by horror and helplessness with the conceptual framework of ptsd in place 
the stage was set for a radical change in our understanding of our patients this
eventually led to an explosion of research and attempts at finding effective
treatments 
inspired by the possibilities presented by this new diagnosis i proposed a
study on the biology of traumatic memories to the va did the memories of
those suffering from ptsd differ from those of others for most people the
memory of an unpleasant event eventually fades or is transformed into
something more benign but most of our patients were unable to make their past
into a story that happened long ago 
7
the opening line of the grant rejection read it has never been shown that

ptsd is relevant to the mission of the veterans administration since then of
course the mission of the va has become organized around the diagnosis of
ptsd and brain injury and considerable resources are dedicated to applying
 evidence based treatments to traumatized war veterans but at the time things
were different and unwilling to keep working in an organization whose view of
reality was so at odds with my own i handed in my resignation in 1982 i took a
position at the massachusetts mental health center the harvard teaching
hospital where i had trained to become a psychiatrist my new responsibility was
to teach a fledgling area of study psychopharmacology the administration of
drugs to alleviate mental illness 
in my new job i was confronted on an almost daily basis with issues i
thought i had left behind at the va my experience with combat veterans had so
sensitized me to the impact of trauma that i now listened with a very different
ear when depressed and anxious patients told me stories of molestation and
family violence i was particularly struck by how many female patients spoke of
being sexually abused as children this was puzzling as the standard textbook of
psychiatry at the time stated that incest was extremely rare in the united states 
occurring about once in every million women 
8
 given that there were then only
about one hundred million women living in the united states i wondered how
forty seven almost half of them had found their way to my office in the
basement of the hospital 
furthermore the textbook said there is little agreement about the role of
father daughter incest as a source of serious subsequent psychopathology my
patients with incest histories were hardly free of subsequent
psychopathology they were profoundly depressed confused and often
engaged in bizarrely self harmful behaviors such as cutting themselves with
razor blades the textbook went on to practically endorse incest explaining that
 such incestuous activity diminishes the subject s chance of psychosis and
allows for a better adjustment to the external world 
9
 in fact as it turned out 
incest had devastating effects on women s well being 
in many ways these patients were not so different from the veterans i had
just left behind at the va they also had nightmares and flashbacks they also
alternated between occasional bouts of explosive rage and long periods of being
emotionally shut down most of them had great difficulty getting along with
other people and had trouble maintaining meaningful relationships 
as we now know war is not the only calamity that leaves human lives in
ruins while about a quarter of the soldiers who serve in war zones are expected

to develop serious posttraumatic problems 
10
 the majority of americans
experience a violent crime at some time during their lives and more accurate
reporting has revealed that twelve million women in the united states have been
victims of rape more than half of all rapes occur in girls below age fifteen 
11
 for
many people the war begins at home each year about three million children in
the united states are reported as victims of child abuse and neglect one million
of these cases are serious and credible enough to force local child protective
services or the courts to take action 
12
 in other words for every soldier who
serves in a war zone abroad there are ten children who are endangered in their
own homes this is particularly tragic since it is very difficult for growing
children to recover when the source of terror and pain is not enemy combatants
but their own caretakers 
a new understanding
in the three decades since i met tom we have learned an enormous amount not
only about the impact and manifestations of trauma but also about ways to help
traumatized people find their way back since the early 1990s brain imaging
tools have started to show us what actually happens inside the brains of
traumatized people this has proven essential to understanding the damage
inflicted by trauma and has guided us to formulate entirely new avenues of
repair 
we have also begun to understand how overwhelming experiences affect our
innermost sensations and our relationship to our physical reality the core of
who we are we have learned that trauma is not just an event that took place
sometime in the past it is also the imprint left by that experience on mind brain 
and body this imprint has ongoing consequences for how the human organism
manages to survive in the present 
trauma results in a fundamental reorganization of the way mind and brain
manage perceptions it changes not only how we think and what we think about 
but also our very capacity to think we have discovered that helping victims of
trauma find the words to describe what has happened to them is profoundly
meaningful but usually it is not enough the act of telling the story doesn t
necessarily alter the automatic physical and hormonal responses of bodies that
remain hypervigilant prepared to be assaulted or violated at any time for real
change to take place the body needs to learn that the danger has passed and to

live in the reality of the present our search to understand trauma has led us to
think differently not only about the structure of the mind but also about the
processes by which it heals

 robert penn warren 
world enough and time
n the late 1960s during a year off between my first and second years of
medical school i became an accidental witness to a profound transition in the
medical approach to mental suffering i had landed a plum job as an attendant on
a research ward at the massachusetts mental health center where i was in
charge of organizing recreational activities for the patients mmhc had long
been considered one of the finest psychiatric hospitals in the country a jewel in
the crown of the harvard medical school teaching empire the goal of the
research on my ward was to determine whether psychotherapy or medication
was the best way to treat young people who had suffered a first mental
breakdown diagnosed as schizophrenia 
the talking cure an offshoot of freudian psychoanalysis was still the

primary treatment for mental illness at mmhc however in the early 1950s a
group of french scientists had discovered a new compound chlorpromazine
 sold under the brand name thorazine that could tranquilize patients and
make them less agitated and delusional that inspired hope that drugs could be
developed to treat serious mental problems such as depression panic anxiety 
and mania as well as to manage some of the most disturbing symptoms of
schizophrenia 
as an attendant i had nothing to do with the research aspect of the ward and
was never told what treatment any of the patients was receiving they were all
close to my age college students from harvard mit and boston university 
some had tried to kill themselves others cut themselves with knives or razor
blades several had attacked their roommates or had otherwise terrified their
parents or friends with their unpredictable irrational behavior my job was to
keep them involved in normal activities for college students such as eating at the
local pizza parlor camping in a nearby state forest attending red sox games 
and sailing on the charles river 
totally new to the field i sat in rapt attention during ward meetings trying
to decipher the patients complicated speech and logic i also had to learn to deal
with their irrational outbursts and terrified withdrawal one morning i found a
patient standing like a statue in her bedroom with one arm raised in a defensive
gesture her face frozen in fear she remained there immobile for at least twelve
hours the doctors gave me the name for her condition catatonia but even the
textbooks i consulted didn t tell me what could be done about it we just let it
run its course 
trauma before dawn
i spent many nights and weekends on the unit which exposed me to things the
doctors never saw during their brief visits when patients could not sleep they
often wandered in their tightly wrapped bathrobes into the darkened nursing
station to talk the quiet of the night seemed to help them open up and they told
me stories about having been hit assaulted or molested often by their own
parents sometimes by relatives classmates or neighbors they shared memories
of lying in bed at night helpless and terrified hearing their mother being beaten
by their father or a boyfriend hearing their parents yell horrible threats at each
other hearing the sounds of furniture breaking others told me about fathers who
came home drunk hearing their footsteps on the landing and how they waited

for them to come in pull them out of bed and punish them for some imagined
offense several of the women recalled lying awake motionless waiting for the
inevitable a brother or father coming in to molest them 
during morning rounds the young doctors presented their cases to their
supervisors a ritual that the ward attendants were allowed to observe in silence 
they rarely mentioned stories like the ones i d heard however many later
studies have confirmed the relevance of those midnight confessions we now
know that more than half the people who seek psychiatric care have been
assaulted abandoned neglected or even raped as children or have witnessed
violence in their families 
1
 but such experiences seemed to be off the table
during rounds i was often surprised by the dispassionate way patients 
symptoms were discussed and by how much time was spent on trying to manage
their suicidal thoughts and self destructive behaviors rather than on
understanding the possible causes of their despair and helplessness i was also
struck by how little attention was paid to their accomplishments and aspirations 
whom they cared for loved or hated what motivated and engaged them what
kept them stuck and what made them feel at peace the ecology of their lives 
a few years later as a young doctor i was confronted with an especially
stark example of the medical model in action i was then moonlighting at a
catholic hospital doing physical examinations on women who d been admitted
to receive electroshock treatment for depression being my curious immigrant
self i d look up from their charts to ask them about their lives many of them
spilled out stories about painful marriages difficult children and guilt over
abortions as they spoke they visibly brightened and often thanked me
effusively for listening to them some of them wondered if they really still
needed electroshock after having gotten so much off their chests i always felt
sad at the end of these meetings knowing that the treatments that would be
administered the following morning would erase all memory of our
conversation i did not last long in that job 
on my days off from the ward at mmhc i often went to the countway
library of medicine to learn more about the patients i was supposed to help 
one saturday afternoon i came across a treatise that is still revered today eugen
bleuler s 1911 textbook 
dementia praecox
 bleuler s observations were
fascinating 
among schizophrenic body hallucinations the sexual ones are by far
the most frequent and the most important all the raptures and joys of

normal and abnormal sexual satisfaction are experienced by these
patients but even more frequently every obscene and disgusting
practice which the most extravagant fantasy can conjure up male
patients have their semen drawn off painful erections are stimulated 
the women patients are raped and injured in the most devilish
ways in spite of the symbolic meaning of many such
hallucinations the majority of them correspond to real sensations 
2
this made me wonder our patients had hallucinations the doctors
routinely asked about them and noted them as signs of how disturbed the
patients were but if the stories i d heard in the wee hours were true could it be
that these hallucinations were in fact the fragmented memories of real
experiences were hallucinations just the concoctions of sick brains could
people make up physical sensations they had never experienced was there a
clear line between creativity and pathological imagination between memory
and imagination these questions remain unanswered to this day but research
has shown that people who ve been abused as children often feel sensations
 such as abdominal pain that have no obvious physical cause they hear voices
warning of danger or accusing them of heinous crimes 
there was no question that many patients on the ward engaged in violent 
bizarre and self destructive behaviors particularly when they felt frustrated 
thwarted or misunderstood they threw temper tantrums hurled plates smashed
windows and cut themselves with shards of glass at that time i had no idea
why someone might react to a simple request let me clean that goop out of
your hair with rage or terror i usually followed the lead of the experienced
nurses who signaled when to back off or if that did not work to restrain a
patient i was surprised and alarmed by the satisfaction i sometimes felt after i d
wrestled a patient to the floor so a nurse could give an injection and i gradually
realized how much of our professional training was geared to helping us stay in
control in the face of terrifying and confusing realities 
sylvia was a gorgeous nineteen year old boston university student who
usually sat alone in the corner of the ward looking frightened to death and
virtually mute but whose reputation as the girlfriend of an important boston
mafioso gave her an aura of mystery after she refused to eat for more than a
week and rapidly started to lose weight the doctors decided to force feed her it
took three of us to hold her down another to push the rubber feeding tube down
her throat and a nurse to pour the liquid nutrients into her stomach later during

a midnight confession sylvia spoke timidly and hesitantly about her childhood
sexual abuse by her brother and uncle i realized then our display of caring 
must have felt to her much like a gang rape this experience and others like it 
helped me formulate this rule for my students if you do something to a patient
that you would not do to your friends or children consider whether you are
unwittingly replicating a trauma from the patient s past 
in my role as recreation leader i noticed other things as a group the patients
were strikingly clumsy and physically uncoordinated when we went camping 
most of them stood helplessly by as i pitched the tents we almost capsized once
in a squall on the charles river because they huddled rigidly in the lee unable to
grasp that they needed to shift position to balance the boat in volleyball games
the staff members invariably were much better coordinated than the patients 
another characteristic they shared was that even their most relaxed
conversations seemed stilted lacking the natural flow of gestures and facial
expressions that are typical among friends the relevance of these observations
became clear only after i d met the body based therapists peter levine and pat
ogden in the later chapters i ll have a lot to say about how trauma is held in
people s bodies 
making sense of suffering
after my year on the research ward i resumed medical school and then as a
newly minted md returned to mmhc to be trained as a psychiatrist a program
to which i was thrilled to be accepted many famous psychiatrists had trained
there including eric kandel who later won the nobel prize in physiology and
medicine allan hobson discovered the brain cells responsible for the generation
of dreams in a lab in the hospital basement while i trained there and the first
studies on the chemical underpinnings of depression were also conducted at
mmhc but for many of us residents the greatest draw was the patients we
spent six hours each day with them and then met as a group with senior
psychiatrists to share our observations pose our questions and compete to make
the wittiest remarks 
our great teacher elvin semrad actively discouraged us from reading
psychiatry textbooks during our first year this intellectual starvation diet may
account for the fact that most of us later became voracious readers and prolific
writers semrad did not want our perceptions of reality to become obscured by
the pseudocertainties of psychiatric diagnoses i remember asking him once 

 what would you call this patient schizophrenic or schizoaffective he
paused and stroked his chin apparently in deep thought i think i d call him
michael mcintyre he replied 
semrad taught us that most human suffering is related to love and loss and
that the job of therapists is to help people acknowledge experience and bear 
the reality of life with all its pleasures and heartbreak the greatest sources of
our suffering are the lies we tell ourselves he d say urging us to be honest with
ourselves about every facet of our experience he often said that people can
never get better without knowing what they know and feeling what they feel 
i remember being surprised to hear this distinguished old harvard professor
confess how comforted he was to feel his wife s bum against him as he fell
asleep at night by disclosing such simple human needs in himself he helped us
recognize how basic they were to our lives failure to attend to them results in a
stunted existence no matter how lofty our thoughts and worldly
accomplishments healing he told us depends on experiential knowledge you
can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of
your body in all its visceral dimensions 
our profession however was moving in a different direction in 1968 the
american journal of psychiatry
 had published the results of the study from the
ward where i d been an attendant they showed unequivocally that
schizophrenic patients who received drugs alone had a better outcome than those
who talked three times a week with the best therapists in boston 
3
 this study
was one of many milestones on a road that gradually changed how medicine and
psychiatry approached psychological problems from infinitely variable
expressions of intolerable feelings and relationships to a brain disease model of
discrete disorders 
the way medicine approaches human suffering has always been determined
by the technology available at any given time before the enlightenment
aberrations in behavior were ascribed to god sin magic witches and evil
spirits it was only in the nineteenth century that scientists in france and
germany began to investigate behavior as an adaptation to the complexities of
the world now a new paradigm was emerging anger lust pride greed 
avarice and sloth as well as all the other problems we humans have always
struggled to manage were recast as disorders that could be fixed by the
administration of appropriate chemicals 
4
 many psychiatrists were relieved and
delighted to become real scientists just like their med school classmates who
had laboratories animal experiments expensive equipment and complicated

diagnostic tests and set aside the wooly headed theories of philosophers like
freud and jung a major textbook of psychiatry went so far as to state the
cause of mental illness is now considered an aberration of the brain a chemical
imbalance 
5
like my colleagues i eagerly embraced the pharmacological revolution in
1973 i became the first chief resident in psychopharmacology at mmhc i may
also have been the first psychiatrist in boston to administer lithium to a manic 
depressive patient i d read about john cade s work with lithium in australia 
and i received permission from a hospital committee to try it on lithium a
woman who had been manic every may for the past thirty five years and
suicidally depressed every november stopped cycling and remained stable for
the three years she was under my care i was also part of the first u s research
team to test the antipsychotic clozaril on chronic patients who were warehoused
in the back wards of the old insane asylums 
6
 some of their responses were
miraculous people who had spent much of their lives locked in their own
separate terrifying realities were now able to return to their families and
communities patients mired in darkness and despair started to respond to the
beauty of human contact and the pleasures of work and play these amazing
results made us optimistic that we could finally conquer human misery 
antipsychotic drugs were a major factor in reducing the number of people
living in mental hospitals in the united states from over 500 000 in 1955 to
fewer than 100 000 in 1996 
7
 for people today who did not know the world
before the advent of these treatments the change is almost unimaginable as a
first year medical student i visited kankakee state hospital in illinois and saw a
burly ward attendant hose down dozens of filthy naked incoherent patients in an
unfurnished dayroom supplied with gutters for the runoff water this memory
now seems more like a nightmare than like something i witnessed with my own
eyes my first job after finishing my residency in 1974 was as the second to last
director of a once venerable institution the boston state hospital which had
formerly housed thousands of patients and been spread over hundreds of acres
with dozens of buildings including greenhouses gardens and workshops most
of them by then in ruins during my time there patients were gradually dispersed
into the community the blanket term for the anonymous shelters and nursing
homes where most of them ended up ironically the hospital was started as an
 asylum a word meaning sanctuary that gradually took on a sinister
connotation it actually did offer a sheltered community where everybody knew
the patients names and idiosyncrasies in 1979 shortly after i went to work at

the va the boston state hospital s gates were permanently locked and it
became a ghost town 
during my time at boston state i continued to work in the mmhc
psychopharmacology lab which was now focusing on another direction for
research in the 1960s scientists at the national institutes of health had begun to
develop techniques for isolating and measuring hormones and neurotransmitters
in blood and the brain neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that carry
information from neuron to neuron enabling us to engage effectively with the
world 
now that scientists were finding evidence that abnormal levels of
norepinephrine were associated with depression and of dopamine with
schizophrenia there was hope that we could develop drugs that target specific
brain abnormalities that hope was never fully realized but our efforts to
measure how drugs could affect mental symptoms led to another profound
change in the profession researchers need for a precise and systematic way to
communicate their findings resulted in the development of the so called
research diagnostic criteria to which i contributed as a lowly research
assistant these eventually became the basis for the first systematic system to
diagnose psychiatric problems the american psychiatric association s
diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
 dsm which is
commonly referred to as the bible of psychiatry the foreword to the landmark
1980 dsm iii was appropriately modest and acknowledged that this diagnostic
system was imprecise so imprecise that it never should be used for forensic or
insurance purposes 
8
 as we will see that modesty was tragically short lived 
inescapable shock
preoccupied with so many lingering questions about traumatic stress i became
intrigued with the idea that the nascent field of neuroscience could provide some
answers and started to attend the meetings of the american college of
neuropsychopharmacology acnp in 1984 the acnp offered many
fascinating lectures about drug development but it was not until a few hours
before my scheduled flight back to boston that i heard a presentation by steven
maier of the university of colorado who had collaborated with martin
seligman of the university of pennsylvania his topic was learned helplessness
in animals maier and seligman had repeatedly administered painful electric

shocks to dogs who were trapped in locked cages they called this condition
 inescapable shock 
9
 being a dog lover i realized that i could never have done
such research myself but i was curious about how this cruelty would affect the
animals 
after administering several courses of electric shock the researchers opened
the doors of the cages and then shocked the dogs again a group of control dogs
who had never been shocked before immediately ran away but the dogs who had
earlier been subjected to inescapable shock made no attempt to flee even when
the door was wide open they just lay there whimpering and defecating the
mere opportunity to escape does not necessarily make traumatized animals or
people take the road to freedom like maier and seligman s dogs many
traumatized people simply give up rather than risk experimenting with new
options they stay stuck in the fear they know 
i was riveted by maier s account what they had done to these poor dogs
was exactly what had happened to my traumatized human patients they too 
had been exposed to somebody or something who had inflicted terrible harm
on them harm they had no way of escaping i made a rapid mental review of
the patients i had treated almost all had in some way been trapped or
immobilized unable to take action to stave off the inevitable their fight flight
response had been thwarted and the result was either extreme agitation or
collapse 
maier and seligman also found that traumatized dogs secreted much larger
amounts of stress hormones than was normal this supported what we were
beginning to learn about the biological underpinnings of traumatic stress a
group of young researchers among them steve southwick and john krystal at
yale arieh shalev at hadassah medical school in jerusalem frank putnam at
the national institute of mental health nimh and roger pitman later at
harvard were all finding that traumatized people keep secreting large amounts
of stress hormones long after the actual danger has passed and rachel yehuda at
mount sinai in new york confronted us with her seemingly paradoxical findings
that the levels of the stress hormone cortisol are low in ptsd her discoveries
only started to make sense when her research clarified that cortisol puts an end to
the stress response by sending an all safe signal and that in ptsd the body s
stress hormones do in fact not return to baseline after the threat has passed 
ideally our stress hormone system should provide a lightning fast response
to threat but then quickly return us to equilibrium in ptsd patients however 
the stress hormone system fails at this balancing act fight flight freeze signals

continue after the danger is over and as in the case of the dogs do not return to
normal instead the continued secretion of stress hormones is expressed as
agitation and panic and in the long term wreaks havoc with their health 
i missed my plane that day because i had to talk with steve maier his
workshop offered clues not only about the underlying problems of my patients
but also potential keys to their resolution for example he and seligman had
found that the only way to teach the traumatized dogs to get off the electric grids
when the doors were open was to repeatedly drag them out of their cages so they
could physically experience how they could get away i wondered if we also
could help my patients with their fundamental orientation that there was nothing
they could do to defend themselves did my patients also need to have 
physical
experiences to restore a visceral sense of control what if they could be taught to
physically move to escape a potentially threatening situation that was similar to
the trauma in which they had been trapped and immobilized as i will discuss in
the treatment part 5 of this book that was one of the conclusions i eventually
reached 
further animal studies involving mice rats cats monkeys and elephants
brought more intriguing data 
10
 for example when researchers played a loud 
intrusive sound mice that had been raised in a warm nest with plenty of food
scurried home immediately but another group raised in a noisy nest with scarce
food supplies also ran for home even after spending time in more pleasant
surroundings 
11
scared animals return home regardless of whether home is safe or
frightening i thought about my patients with abusive families who kept going
back to be hurt again are traumatized people condemned to seek refuge in what
is familiar if so why and is it possible to help them become attached to places
and activities that are safe and pleasurable 
12
addicted to trauma the pain of pleasure and
the pleasure of pain
one of the things that struck my colleague mark greenberg and me when we ran
therapy groups for vietnam combat veterans was how despite their feelings of
horror and grief many of them seemed to come to life when they talked about
their helicopter crashes and their dying comrades former 
new york times
correspondent chris hedges who covered a number of brutal conflicts entitled

his book 
war is a force that gives us meaning
 
13
 many traumatized people
seem to seek out experiences that would repel most of us 
14
 and patients often
complain about a vague sense of emptiness and boredom when they are not
angry under duress or involved in some dangerous activity 
my patient julia was brutally raped at gunpoint in a hotel room at age
sixteen shortly thereafter she got involved with a violent pimp who prostituted
her he regularly beat her up she was repeatedly jailed for prostitution but she
always went back to her pimp finally her grandparents intervened and paid for
an intense rehab program after she successfully completed inpatient treatment 
she started working as a receptionist and taking courses at a local college in her
sociology class she wrote a term paper about the liberating possibilities of
prostitution for which she read the memoirs of several famous prostitutes she
gradually dropped all her other courses a brief relationship with a classmate
quickly went sour he bored her to tears she said and she was repelled by his
boxer shorts she then picked up an addict on the subway who first beat her up
and then started to stalk her she finally became motivated to return to treatment
when she was once again severely beaten 
freud had a term for such traumatic reenactments the compulsion to
repeat he and many of his followers believed that reenactments were an
unconscious attempt to get control over a painful situation and that they
eventually could lead to mastery and resolution there is no evidence for that
theory repetition leads only to further pain and self hatred in fact even
reliving the trauma repeatedly in therapy may reinforce preoccupation and
fixation 
mark greenberg and i decided to learn more about attractors the things
that draw us motivate us and make us feel alive normally attractors are meant
to make us feel better so why are so many people attracted to dangerous or
painful situations we eventually found a study that explained how activities that
cause fear or pain can later become thrilling experiences 
15
 in the 1970s richard
solomon of the university of pennsylvania had shown that the body learns to
adjust to all sorts of stimuli we may get hooked on recreational drugs because
they right away make us feel so good but activities like sauna bathing marathon
running or parachute jumping which initially cause discomfort and even terror 
can ultimately become very enjoyable this gradual adjustment signals that a
new chemical balance has been established within the body so that marathon
runners say get a sense of well being and exhilaration from pushing their bodies
to the limit 

at this point just as with drug addiction we start to crave the activity and
experience withdrawal when it s not available in the long run people become
more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity itself this
theory could explain why some people hire someone to beat them or burn
themselves with cigarettes or why they are only attracted to people who hurt
them fear and aversion in some perverse way can be transformed into
pleasure 
solomon hypothesized that endorphins the morphinelike chemicals that
the brain secretes in response to stress play a role in the paradoxical addictions
he described i thought of his theory again when my library habit led me to a
paper titled pain in men wounded in battle published in 1946 having
observed that 75 percent of severely wounded soldiers on the italian front did
not request morphine a surgeon by the name of henry k beecher speculated
that strong emotions can block pain 
16
were beecher s observations relevant to people with ptsd mark
greenberg roger pitman scott orr and i decided to ask eight vietnam combat
veterans if they would be willing to take a standard pain test while they watched
scenes from a number of movies the first clip we showed was from oliver
stone s graphically violent 
platoon
 1986 
 
and while it ran we measured how
long the veterans could keep their right hands in a bucket of ice water we then
repeated this process with a peaceful and long forgotten movie clip seven of
the eight veterans kept their hands in the painfully cold water 30 percent longer
during 
platoon
 we then calculated that the amount of analgesia produced by
watching fifteen minutes of a combat movie was equivalent to that produced by
being injected with eight milligrams of morphine about the same dose a person
would receive in an emergency room for crushing chest pain 
we concluded that beecher s speculation that strong emotions can block
pain was the result of the release of morphinelike substances manufactured in
the brain this suggested that for many traumatized people reexposure to stress
might provide a similar relief from anxiety 
17
 it was an interesting experiment 
but it did not fully explain why julia kept going back to her violent pimp 
soothing the brain
the 1985 acnp meeting was if possible even more thought provoking than the
previous year s session kings college professor jeffrey gray gave a talk about

the amygdala a cluster of brain cells that determines whether a sound image or
body sensation is perceived as a threat gray s data showed that the sensitivity of
the amygdala depended at least in part on the amount of the neurotransmitter
serotonin in that part of the brain animals with low serotonin levels were
hyperreactive to stressful stimuli like loud sounds while higher levels of
serotonin dampened their fear system making them less likely to become
aggressive or frozen in response to potential threats 
18
that struck me as an important finding my patients were always blowing
up in response to small provocations and felt devastated by the slightest
rejection i became fascinated by the possible role of serotonin in ptsd other
researchers had shown that dominant male monkeys had much higher levels of
brain serotonin than lower ranking animals but that their serotonin levels
dropped when they were prevented from maintaining eye contact with the
monkeys they had once lorded over in contrast low ranking monkeys who were
given serotonin supplements emerged from the pack to assume leadership 
19
 the
social environment interacts with brain chemistry manipulating a monkey into a
lower position in the dominance hierarchy made his serotonin drop while
chemically enhancing serotonin elevated the rank of former subordinates 
the implications for traumatized people were obvious like gray s low 
serotonin animals they were hyperreactive and their ability to cope socially was
often compromised if we could find ways to increase brain serotonin levels 
perhaps we could address both problems simultaneously at that same 1985
meeting i learned that drug companies were developing two new products to do
precisely that but since neither was yet available i experimented briefly with
the health food store supplement l tryptophan which is a chemical precursor of
serotonin in the body the results were disappointing one of the drugs under
investigation never made it to the market the other was fluoxetine which 
under the brand name prozac became one of the most successful psychoactive
drugs ever created 
on monday february 8 1988 prozac was released by the drug company
eli lilly the first patient i saw that day was a young woman with a horrendous
history of childhood abuse who was now struggling with bulimia she basically
spent much of her life bingeing and purging i gave her a prescription for this
brand new drug and when she returned on thursday she said i ve had a very
different last few days i ate when i was hungry and the rest of the time i did my
schoolwork this was one of the most dramatic statements i had ever heard in
my office 

on friday i saw another patient to whom i d given prozac the previous
monday she was a chronically depressed mother of two school aged children 
preoccupied with her failures as a mother and wife and overwhelmed by
demands from the parents who had badly mistreated her as a child after four
days on prozac she asked me if she could skip her appointment the following
monday which was presidents day after all she explained i ve never
taken my kids skiing my husband always does and they are off that day it
would really be nice for them to have some good memories of us having fun
together 
this was a patient who had always struggled merely to get through the day 
after her appointment i called someone i knew at eli lilly and said you have a
drug that helps people to be in the present instead of being locked in the past 
lilly later gave me a small grant to study the effects of prozac on ptsd in sixty 
four people twenty two women and forty two men the first study of the
effects of this new class of drugs on ptsd our trauma clinic team enrolled
thirty three nonveterans and my collaborators former colleagues at the va 
enrolled thirty one combat veterans for eight weeks half of each group received
prozac and the other half a placebo the study was blinded neither we nor the
patients knew which substance they were taking so that our preconceptions
could not skew our assessments 
everyone in the study even those who had received the placebo 
improved at least to some degree most treatment studies of ptsd find a
significant placebo effect people who screw up their courage to participate in a
study for which they aren t paid in which they re repeatedly poked with needles 
and in which they have only a fifty fifty chance of getting an active drug are
intrinsically motivated to solve their problem maybe their reward is only the
attention paid to them the opportunity to respond to questions about how they
feel and think but maybe the mother s kisses that soothe her child s scrapes are
 just a placebo as well 
prozac worked significantly better than the placebo for the patients from the
trauma clinic they slept more soundly they had more control over their
emotions and were less preoccupied with the past than those who received a
sugar pill 
20
 surprisingly however the prozac had no effect at all on the combat
veterans at the va their ptsd symptoms were unchanged these results have
held true for most subsequent pharmacological studies on veterans while a few
have shown modest improvements most have not benefited at all i have never
been able to explain this and i cannot accept the most common explanation that

receiving a pension or disability benefits prevents people from getting better 
after all the amygdala knows nothing of pensions it just detects threats 
nonetheless medications such as prozac and related drugs like zoloft 
celexa cymbalta and paxil have made a substantial contribution to the
treatment of trauma related disorders in our prozac study we used the
rorschach test to measure how traumatized people perceive their surroundings 
these data gave us an important clue to how this class of drugs formally known
as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or ssris might work before taking
prozac these patients emotions controlled their reactions i think of a dutch
patient for example not in the prozac study who came to see me for treatment
for a childhood rape and who was convinced that i would rape her as soon as she
heard my dutch accent prozac made a radical difference it gave ptsd patients
a sense of perspective
21
 and helped them to gain considerable control over their
impulses jeffrey gray must have been right when their serotonin levels rose 
many of my patients became less reactive 
the triumph of pharmacology
it did not take long for pharmacology to revolutionize psychiatry drugs gave
doctors a greater sense of efficacy and provided a tool beyond talk therapy 
drugs also produced income and profits grants from the pharmaceutical
industry provided us with laboratories filled with energetic graduate students and
sophisticated instruments psychiatry departments which had always been
located in the basements of hospitals started to move up both in terms of
location and prestige 
one symbol of this change occurred at mmhc where in the early 1990s the
hospital s swimming pool was paved over to make space for a laboratory and
the indoor basketball court was carved up into cubicles for the new medication
clinic for decades doctors and patients had democratically shared the pleasures
of splashing in the pool and passing balls down the court i d spent hours in the
gym with patients back when i was a ward attendant it was the one place where
we all could restore a sense of physical well being an island in the midst of the
misery we faced every day now it had become a place for patients to get
fixed 
the drug revolution that started out with so much promise may in the end
have done as much harm as good the theory that mental illness is caused

primarily by chemical imbalances in the brain that can be corrected by specific
drugs has become broadly accepted by the media and the public as well as by
the medical profession 
22
 in many places drugs have displaced therapy and
enabled patients to suppress their problems without addressing the underlying
issues antidepressants can make all the difference in the world in helping with
day to day functioning and if it comes to a choice between taking a sleeping pill
and drinking yourself into a stupor every night to get a few hours of sleep there
is no question which is preferable for people who are exhausted from trying to
make it on their own through yoga classes workout routines or simply toughing
it out medications often can bring life saving relief the ssris can be very
helpful in making traumatized people less enslaved by their emotions but they
should only be considered adjuncts in their overall treatment 
23
after conducting numerous studies of medications for ptsd i have come to
realize that psychiatric medications have a serious downside as they may deflect
attention from dealing with the underlying issues the brain disease model takes
control over people s fate out of their own hands and puts doctors and insurance
companies in charge of fixing their problems 
over the past three decades psychiatric medications have become a
mainstay in our culture with dubious consequences consider the case of
antidepressants if they were indeed as effective as we have been led to believe 
depression should by now have become a minor issue in our society instead 
even as antidepressant use continues to increase it has not made a dent in
hospital admissions for depression the number of people treated for depression
has tripled over the past two decades and one in ten americans now take
antidepressants 
24
the new generation of antipsychotics such as abilify risperdal zyprexa 
and seroquel are the top selling drugs in the united states in 2012 the public
spent 1 526 228 000 on abilify more than on any other medication number
three was cymbalta an antidepressant that sold well over a billion dollars worth
of pills 
25
 even though it has never been shown to be superior to older
antidepressants like prozac for which much cheaper generics are available 
medicaid the government health program for the poor spends more on
antipsychotics than on any other class of drugs 
26
 in 2008 the most recent year
for which complete data are available it funded 3 6 billion for antipsychotic
medications up from 1 65 billion in 1999 the number of people under the age
of twenty receiving medicaid funded prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs
tripled between 1999 and 2008 on november 4 2013 johnson johnson

agreed to pay more than 2 2 billion in criminal and civil fines to settle
accusations that it had improperly promoted the antipsychotic drug risperdal to
older adults children and people with developmental disabilities 
27
 but nobody
is holding the doctors who prescribed them accountable 
half a million children in the united states currently take antipsychotic
drugs children from low income families are four times as likely as privately
insured children to receive antipsychotic medicines these medications often are
used to make abused and neglected children more tractable in 2008 19 045
children age five and under were prescribed antipsychotics through medicaid 
28
one study based on medicaid data in thirteen states found that 12 4 percent of
children in foster care received antipsychotics compared with 1 4 percent of
medicaid eligible children in general 
29
 these medications make children more
manageable and less aggressive but they also interfere with motivation play 
and curiosity which are indispensable for maturing into a well functioning and
contributing member of society children who take them are also at risk of
becoming morbidly obese and developing diabetes meanwhile drug overdoses
involving a combination of psychiatric and pain medications continue to rise 
30
because drugs have become so profitable major medical journals rarely
publish studies on nondrug treatments of mental health problems 
31
 practitioners
who explore treatments are typically marginalized as alternative studies of
nondrug treatments are rarely funded unless they involve so called manualized
protocols where patients and therapists go through narrowly prescribed
sequences that allow little fine tuning to individual patients needs mainstream
medicine is firmly committed to a better life through chemistry and the fact that
we can actually change our own physiology and inner equilibrium by means
other than drugs is rarely considered 
adaptation or disease 
the brain disease model overlooks four fundamental truths 1 our capacity to
destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one another restoring
relationships and community is central to restoring well being 2 language
gives us the power to change ourselves and others by communicating our
experiences helping us to define what we know and finding a common sense of
meaning 3 we have the ability to regulate our own physiology including some
of the so called involuntary functions of the body and brain through such basic

activities as breathing moving and touching and 4 we can change social
conditions to create environments in which children and adults can feel safe and
where they can thrive 
when we ignore these quintessential dimensions of humanity we deprive
people of ways to heal from trauma and restore their autonomy being a patient 
rather than a participant in one s healing process separates suffering people from
their community and alienates them from an inner sense of self given the
limitations of drugs i started to wonder if we could find more natural ways to
help people deal with their post traumatic responses

 yogi berra
n the early 1990s novel brain imaging techniques opened up undreamed of
capacities to gain a sophisticated understanding about the way the brain
processes information gigantic multimillion dollar machines based on advanced
physics and computer technology rapidly made neuroscience into one of the
most popular areas for research positron emission tomography pet and later 
functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri enabled scientists to visualize
how different parts of the brain are activated when people are engaged in certain
tasks or when they remember events from the past for the first time we could
watch the brain as it processed memories sensations and emotions and begin to
map the circuits of mind and consciousness the earlier technology of measuring

brain chemicals like serotonin or norepinephrine had enabled scientists to look at
what 
fueled
 neural activity which is a bit like trying to understand a car s engine
by studying gasoline neuroimaging made it possible to see inside the engine 
by doing so it has also transformed our understanding of trauma 
harvard medical school was and is at the forefront of the neuroscience
revolution and in 1994 a young psychiatrist scott rauch was appointed as the
first director of the massachusetts general hospital neuroimaging laboratory 
after considering the most relevant questions that this new technology could
answer and reading some articles i had written scott asked me whether i
thought we could study what happens in the brains of people who have
flashbacks 
i had just finished a study on how trauma is remembered to be discussed in
chapter 12 in which participants repeatedly told me how upsetting it was to be
suddenly hijacked by images feelings and sounds from the past when several
said they wished they knew what trick their brains were playing on them during
these flashbacks i asked eight of them if they would be willing to return to the
clinic and lie still inside a scanner an entirely new experience that i described in
detail while we re created a scene from the painful events that haunted them to
my surprise all eight agreed many of them expressing their hope that what we
learned from their suffering could help other people 
my research assistant rita fisler who was working with us prior to
entering harvard medical school sat down with every participant and carefully
constructed a script that re created their trauma moment to moment we
deliberately tried to collect just isolated fragments of their experience 
particular images sounds and feelings rather than the entire story because that
is how trauma is experienced rita also asked the participants to describe a scene
where they felt safe and in control one person described her morning routine 
another sitting on the porch of a farmhouse in vermont overlooking the hills 
we would use this script for a second scan to provide a baseline measurement 
after the participants checked the scripts for accuracy reading silently 
which is less overwhelming than hearing or speaking rita made a voice
recording that would be played back to them while they were in the scanner a
typical script 
you are six years old and getting ready for bed you hear your mother
and father yelling at each other you are frightened and your stomach is
in a knot you and your younger brother and sister are huddled at the

top of the stairs you look over the banister and see your father holding
your mother s arms while she struggles to free herself your mother is
crying spitting and hissing like an animal your face is flushed and you
feel hot all over when your mother frees herself she runs to the dining
room and breaks a very expensive chinese vase you yell at your
parents to stop but they ignore you your mom runs upstairs and you
hear her breaking the tv your little brother and sister try to get her to
hide in the closet your heart pounds and you are trembling 
at this first session we explained the purpose of the radioactive oxygen the
participants would be breathing as any part of the brain became more or less
metabolically active its rate of oxygen consumption would immediately change 
which would be picked up by the scanner we would monitor their blood
pressure and heart rate throughout the procedure so that these physiological
signs could be compared with brain activity 
several days later the participants came to the imaging lab marsha a forty 
year old schoolteacher from a suburb outside of boston was the first volunteer
to be scanned her script took her back to the day thirteen years earlier when
she picked up her five year old daughter melissa from day camp as they drove
off marsha heard a persistent beeping indicating that melissa s seatbelt was not
properly fastened when marsha reached over to adjust the belt she ran a red
light another car smashed into hers from the right instantly killing her
daughter in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room the seven month 
old fetus marsha was carrying also died 
overnight marsha had changed from a cheerful woman who was the life of
the party into a haunted and depressed person filled with self blame she moved
from classroom teaching into school administration because working directly
with children had become intolerable as for many parents who have lost
children their happy laughter had become a powerful trigger even hiding
behind her paperwork she could barely make it through the day in a futile
attempt to keep her feelings at bay she coped by working day and night 
i was standing outside the scanner as marsha underwent the procedure and
could follow her physiological reactions on a monitor the moment we turned on
the tape recorder her heart started to race and her blood pressure jumped 
simply hearing the script similar activated the same physiological responses that
had occurred during the accident thirteen years earlier after the recorded script
concluded and marsha s heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal we

played her second script getting out of bed and brushing her teeth this time her
heart rate and blood pressure did not change 
as she emerged from the scanner marsha looked defeated drawn out and
frozen her breathing was shallow her eyes were opened wide and her
shoulders were hunched the very image of vulnerability and defenselessness 
we tried to comfort her but i wondered if whatever we discovered would be
worth the price of her distress 
picturing the brain on trauma 
 bright spots in a the limbic brain and b the visual cortex show
heightened activation in drawing c the brain s speech center shows markedly decreased activation 
after all eight participants completed the procedure scott rauch went to
work with his mathematicians and statisticians to create composite images that
compared the arousal created by a flashback with the brain in neutral after a
few weeks he sent me the results which you see above i taped the scans up on
the refrigerator in my kitchen and for the next few months i stared at them every
evening it occurred to me that this was how early astronomers must have felt
when they peered through a telescope at a new constellation 
there were some puzzling dots and colors on the scan but the biggest area
of brain activation a large red spot in the right lower center of the brain which
is the limbic area or emotional brain came as no surprise it was already well
known that intense emotions activate the limbic system in particular an area
within it called the amygdala we depend on the amygdala to warn us of
impending danger and to activate the body s stress response our study clearly
showed that when traumatized people are presented with images sounds or
thoughts related to their particular experience the amygdala reacts with alarm 

even as in marsha s case thirteen years after the event activation of this fear
center triggers the cascade of stress hormones and nerve impulses that drive up
blood pressure heart rate and oxygen intake preparing the body for fight or
flight 
1
 the monitors attached to marsha s arms recorded this physiological state
of frantic arousal even though she never totally lost track of the fact that she was
resting quietly in the scanner 
speechless horror
our most surprising finding was a white spot in the left frontal lobe of the
cortex in a region called broca s area in this case the change in color meant that
there was a significant decrease in that part of the brain broca s area is one of
the speech centers of the brain which is often affected in stroke patients when
the blood supply to that region is cut off without a functioning broca s area 
you cannot put your thoughts and feelings into words our scans showed that
broca s area went offline whenever a flashback was triggered in other words 
we had visual proof that the effects of trauma are not necessarily different from
 and can overlap with the effects of physical lesions like strokes 
all trauma is preverbal shakespeare captures this state of speechless terror
in 
macbeth
 after the murdered king s body is discovered
 
 oh horror horror 
horror tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee confusion now hath
made his masterpiece under extreme conditions people may scream
obscenities call for their mothers howl in terror or simply shut down victims
of assaults and accidents sit mute and frozen in emergency rooms traumatized
children lose their tongues and refuse to speak photographs of combat
soldiers show hollow eyed men staring mutely into a void 
even years later traumatized people often have enormous difficulty telling
other people what has happened to them their bodies reexperience terror rage 
and helplessness as well as the impulse to fight or flee but these feelings are
almost impossible to articulate trauma by nature drives us to the edge of
comprehension cutting us off from language based on common experience or an
imaginable past 
this doesn t mean that people can t talk about a tragedy that has befallen
them sooner or later most survivors like the veterans in chapter 1 come up
with what many of them call their cover story that offers some explanation for
their symptoms and behavior for public consumption these stories however 

rarely capture the inner truth of the experience it is enormously difficult to
organize one s traumatic experiences into a coherent account a narrative with a
beginning a middle and an end even a seasoned reporter like the famed cbs
correspondent ed murrow struggled to convey the atrocities he saw when the
nazi concentration camp buchenwald was liberated in 1945 i pray you believe
what i have said i reported what i saw and heard but only part of it for most of
it i have no words 
when words fail haunting images capture the experience and return as
nightmares and flashbacks in contrast to the deactivation of broca s area 
another region brodmann s area 19 lit up in our participants this is a region in
the visual cortex that registers images when they first enter the brain we were
surprised to see brain activation in this area so long after the original experience
of the trauma under ordinary conditions raw images registered in area 19 are
rapidly diffused to other brain areas that interpret the meaning of what has been
seen once again we were witnessing a brain region rekindled as if the trauma
were actually occurring 
as we will see in chapter 12 which discusses memory other unprocessed
sense fragments of trauma like sounds and smells and physical sensations are
also registered separately from the story itself similar sensations often trigger a
flashback that brings them back into consciousness apparently unmodified by
the passage of time 
shifting to one side of the brain
the scans also revealed that during flashbacks our subjects brains lit up only on
the right side today there s a huge body of scientific and popular literature
about the difference between the right and left brains back in the early nineties i
had heard that some people had begun to divide the world between left brainers
 rational logical people and right brainers the intuitive artistic ones but i
hadn t paid much attention to this idea however our scans clearly showed that
images of past trauma activate the right hemisphere of the brain and deactivate
the left 
we now know that the two halves of the brain do speak different languages 
the right is intuitive emotional visual spatial and tactual and the left is
linguistic sequential and analytical while the left half of the brain does all the
talking the right half of the brain carries the music of experience it
communicates through facial expressions and body language and by making the

sounds of love and sorrow by singing swearing crying dancing or mimicking 
the right brain is the first to develop in the womb and it carries the nonverbal
communication between mothers and infants we know the left hemisphere has
come online when children start to understand language and learn how to speak 
this enables them to name things compare them understand their interrelations 
and begin to communicate their own unique subjective experiences to others 
the left and right sides of the brain also process the imprints of the past in
dramatically different ways 
2
 the left brain remembers facts statistics and the
vocabulary of events we call on it to explain our experiences and put them in
order the right brain stores memories of sound touch smell and the emotions
they evoke it reacts automatically to voices facial features and gestures and
places experienced in the past what it recalls feels like intuitive truth the way
things are even as we enumerate a loved one s virtues to a friend our feelings
may be more deeply stirred by how her face recalls the aunt we loved at age
four 
3
under ordinary circumstances the two sides of the brain work together more
or less smoothly even in people who might be said to favor one side over the
other however having one side or the other shut down even temporarily or
having one side cut off entirely as sometimes happened in early brain surgery 
is disabling 
deactivation of the left hemisphere has a direct impact on the capacity to
organize experience into logical sequences and to translate our shifting feelings
and perceptions into words broca s area which blacks out during flashbacks is
on the left side without sequencing we can t identify cause and effect grasp
the long term effects of our actions or create coherent plans for the future 
people who are very upset sometimes say they are losing their minds in
technical terms they are experiencing the loss of executive functioning 
when something reminds traumatized people of the past their right brain
reacts as if the traumatic event were happening in the present but because their
left brain is not working very well they may not be aware that they are
reexperiencing and reenacting the past they are just furious terrified enraged 
ashamed or frozen after the emotional storm passes they may look for
something or somebody to blame for it they behaved the way they did way
because 
you
 were ten minutes late or because 
you
 burned the potatoes or
because 
you
 never listen to me of course most of us have done this from time
to time but when we cool down we hopefully can admit our mistake trauma
interferes with this kind of awareness and over time our research demonstrated

why 
stuck in fight or flight
what had happened to marsha in the scanner gradually started to make sense 
thirteen years after her tragedy we had activated the sensations the sounds and
images from the accident that were still stored in her memory when these
sensations came to the surface they activated her alarm system which caused
her to react as if she were back in the hospital being told that her daughter had
died the passage of thirteen years was erased her sharply increased heart rate
and blood pressure readings reflected her physiological state of frantic alarm 
adrenaline is one of the hormones that are critical to help us fight back or
flee in the face of danger increased adrenaline was responsible for our
participants dramatic rise in heart rate and blood pressure while listening to their
trauma narrative under normal conditions people react to a threat with a
temporary increase in their stress hormones as soon as the threat is over the
hormones dissipate and the body returns to normal the stress hormones of
traumatized people in contrast take much longer to return to baseline and spike
quickly and disproportionately in response to mildly stressful stimuli the
insidious effects of constantly elevated stress hormones include memory and
attention problems irritability and sleep disorders they also contribute to many
long term health issues depending on which body system is most vulnerable in a
particular individual 
we now know that there is another possible response to threat which our
scans aren t yet capable of measuring some people simply go into denial their
bodies register the threat but their conscious minds go on as if nothing has
happened however even though the mind may learn to ignore the messages
from the emotional brain the alarm signals don t stop the emotional brain
keeps working and stress hormones keep sending signals to the muscles to tense
for action or immobilize in collapse the physical effects on the organs go on
unabated until they demand notice when they are expressed as illness 
medications drugs and alcohol can also temporarily dull or obliterate
unbearable sensations and feelings but the body continues to keep the score 
we can interpret what happened to marsha in the scanner from several
different perspectives each of which has implications for treatment we can
focus on the neurochemical and physiological disruptions that were so evident
and make a case that she is suffering from a biochemical imbalance that is

reactivated whenever she is reminded of her daughter s death we might then
search for a drug or a combination of drugs that would damp down the reaction
or in the best case restore her chemical equilibrium based on the results of our
scans some of my colleagues at mgh began investigating drugs that might
make people less responsive to the effects of elevated adrenaline 
we can also make a strong case that marsha is hypersensitized to her
memories of the past and that the best treatment would be some form of
desensitization 
4
 after repeatedly rehearsing the details of the trauma with a
therapist her biological responses might become muted so that she could realize
and remember that that was then and this is now rather than reliving the
experience over and over 
for a hundred years or more every textbook of psychology and
psychotherapy has advised that some method of talking about distressing
feelings can resolve them however as we ve seen the experience of trauma
itself gets in the way of being able to do that no matter how much insight and
understanding we develop the rational brain is basically impotent to talk the
emotional brain out of its own reality i am continually impressed by how
difficult it is for people who have gone through the unspeakable to convey the
essence of their experience it is so much easier for them to talk about what has
been done to them to tell a story of victimization and revenge than to notice 
feel and put into words the reality of their internal experience 
our scans had revealed how their dread persisted and could be triggered by
multiple aspects of daily experience they had not integrated their experience
into the ongoing stream of their life they continued to be there and did not
know how to be here fully alive in the present 
three years after being a participant in our study marsha came to see me as
a patient i successfully treated her with emdr the subject of chapter 15

n september 11 2001 five year old noam saul witnessed the first
passenger plane slam into the world trade center from the windows of his
first grade classroom at ps 234 less than 1 500 feet away he and his classmates
ran with their teacher down the stairs to the lobby where most of them were
reunited with parents who had dropped them off at school just moments earlier 
noam his older brother and their dad were three of the tens of thousands of
people who ran for their lives through the rubble ash and smoke of lower
manhattan that morning 
ten days later i visited his family who are friends of mine and that evening
his parents and i went for a walk in the eerie darkness through the still smoking
pit where tower one once stood making our way among the rescue crews who
were working around the clock under the blazing klieg lights when we returned
home noam was still awake and he showed me a picture that he had drawn at
9 00 a m on september 12 the drawing depicted what he had seen the day
before an airplane slamming into the tower a ball of fire firefighters and
people jumping from the tower s windows but at the bottom of the picture he

had drawn something else a black circle at the foot of the buildings i had no
idea what it was so i asked him a trampoline he replied what was a
trampoline doing there noam explained so that the next time when people
have to jump they will be safe i was stunned this five year old boy a witness
to unspeakable mayhem and disaster just twenty four hours before he made that
drawing had used his imagination to process what he had seen and begin to go
on with his life 
noam was fortunate his entire family was unharmed he had grown up
surrounded by love and he was able to grasp that the tragedy they had witnessed
had come to an end during disasters young children usually take their cues from
their parents as long as their caregivers remain calm and responsive to their
needs they often survive terrible incidents without serious psychological scars 
five year old noam s drawing made after he witnessed the world trade center attack on 9 11 
he reproduced the image that haunted so many survivors people jumping to escape from the inferno
 but with a lifesaving addition a trampoline at the bottom of the collapsing building 
but noam s experience allows us to see in outline two critical aspects of the
adaptive response to threat that is basic to human survival at the time the
disaster occurred he was able to take an active role by running away from it 

thus becoming an agent in his own rescue and once he had reached the safety of
home the alarm bells in his brain and body quieted this freed his mind to make
some sense of what had happened and even to imagine a creative alternative to
what he had seen a lifesaving trampoline 
in contrast to noam traumatized people become stuck stopped in their
growth because they can t integrate new experiences into their lives i was very
moved when the veterans of patton s army gave me a world war ii army issue
watch for christmas but it was a sad memento of the year their lives had
effectively stopped 1944 being traumatized means continuing to organize your
life as if the trauma were still going on unchanged and immutable as every
new encounter or event is contaminated by the past 
trauma affects the entire human organism body mind and brain in ptsd the body continues to
defend against a threat that belongs to the past healing from ptsd means being able to terminate
this continued stress mobilization and restoring the entire organism to safety 
after trauma the world is experienced with a different nervous system the
survivor s energy now becomes focused on suppressing inner chaos at the
expense of spontaneous involvement in their lives these attempts to maintain
control over unbearable physiological reactions can result in a whole range of
physical symptoms including fibromyalgia chronic fatigue and other

autoimmune diseases this explains why it is critical for trauma treatment to
engage the entire organism body mind and brain 
organized to survive
this illustration on page 53 shows the whole body response to threat 
when the brain s alarm system is turned on it automatically triggers
preprogrammed physical escape plans in the oldest parts of the brain as in other
animals the nerves and chemicals that make up our basic brain structure have a
direct connection with our body when the old brain takes over it partially shuts
down the higher brain our conscious mind and propels the body to run hide 
fight or on occasion freeze by the time we are fully aware of our situation our
body may already be on the move if the fight flight freeze response is
successful and we escape the danger we recover our internal equilibrium and
gradually regain our senses

effective action versus immobilization 
 effective action the result of fight flight ends the threat 
immobilization keeps the body in a state of inescapable shock and learned helplessness faced with
danger people automatically secrete stress hormones to fuel resistance and escape brain and body are
programmed to run for home where safety can be restored and stress hormones can come to rest in
these strapped down men who are being evacuated far from home after hurricane katrina stress
hormone levels remain elevated and are turned against the survivors stimulating ongoing fear 
depression rage and physical disease 
if for some reason the normal response is blocked
 
for example when
people are held down trapped or otherwise prevented from taking effective
action be it in a war zone a car accident domestic violence or a rape the
brain keeps secreting stress chemicals and the brain s electrical circuits continue
to fire in vain 
2
 long after the actual event has passed the brain may keep
sending signals to the body to escape a threat that no longer exists since at least
1889 when the french psychologist pierre janet published the first scientific
account of traumatic stress 
3
 it has been recognized that trauma survivors are
prone to continue the action or rather the futile attempt at action which
began when the thing happened being able to move and 
do
 something to
protect oneself is a critical factor in determining whether or not a horrible
experience will leave long lasting scars 
in this chapter i m going to go deeper into the brain s response to trauma 

the more neuroscience discovers about the brain the more we realize that it is a
vast network of interconnected parts organized to help us survive and flourish 
knowing how these parts work together is essential to understanding how
trauma affects every part of the human organism and can serve as an
indispensable guide to resolving traumatic stress 
the brain from bottom to top
the most important job of the brain is to ensure our survival even under the
most miserable conditions everything else is secondary in order to do that 
brains need to 1 generate internal signals that register what our bodies need 
such as food rest protection sex and shelter 2 create a map of the world to
point us where to go to satisfy those needs 3 generate the necessary energy
and actions to get us there 4 warn us of dangers and opportunities along the
way and 5 adjust our actions based on the requirements of the moment 
4
 and
since we human beings are mammals creatures that can only survive and thrive
in groups all of these imperatives require coordination and collaboration 
psychological problems occur when our internal signals don t work when our
maps don t lead us where we need to go when we are too paralyzed to move 
when our actions do not correspond to our needs or when our relationships
break down every brain structure that i discuss has a role to play in these
essential functions and as we will see trauma can interfere with every one of
them 
our rational cognitive brain is actually the youngest part of the brain and
occupies only about 30 percent of the area inside our skull the rational brain is
primarily concerned with the world outside us understanding how things and
people work and figuring out how to accomplish our goals manage our time 
and sequence our actions beneath the rational brain lie two evolutionarily older 
and to some degree separate brains which are in charge of everything else the
moment by moment registration and management of our body s physiology and
the identification of comfort safety threat hunger fatigue desire longing 
excitement pleasure and pain 
the brain is built from the bottom up it develops level by level within every
child in the womb just as it did in the course of evolution the most primitive
part the part that is already online when we are born is the ancient animal brain 
often called the reptilian brain it is located in the brain stem just above the

place where our spinal cord enters the skull the reptilian brain is responsible for
all the things that newborn babies can do eat sleep wake cry breathe feel
temperature hunger wetness and pain and rid the body of toxins by urinating
and defecating the brain stem and the hypothalamus which sits directly above
it together control the energy levels of the body they coordinate the
functioning of the heart and lungs and also the endocrine and immune systems 
ensuring that these basic life sustaining systems are maintained within the
relatively stable internal balance known as homeostasis 
breathing eating sleeping pooping and peeing are so fundamental that
their significance is easily neglected when we re considering the complexities of
mind and behavior however if your sleep is disturbed or your bowels don t
work or if you always feel hungry or if being touched makes you want to
scream as is often the case with traumatized children and adults the entire
organism is thrown into disequilibrium it is amazing how many psychological
problems involve difficulties with sleep appetite touch digestion and arousal 
any effective treatment for trauma has to address these basic housekeeping
functions of the body 
right above the reptilian brain is the limbic system it s also known as the
mammalian brain because all animals that live in groups and nurture their young
possess one development of this part of the brain truly takes off after a baby is
born it is the seat of the emotions the monitor of danger the judge of what is
pleasurable or scary the arbiter of what is or is not important for survival
purposes it is also a central command post for coping with the challenges of
living within our complex social networks 
the limbic system is shaped in response to experience in partnership with
the infant s own genetic makeup and inborn temperament as all parents of
more than one child quickly notice babies differ from birth in the intensity and
nature of their reactions to similar events whatever happens to a baby
contributes to the emotional and perceptual map of the world that its developing
brain creates as my colleague bruce perry explains it the brain is formed in a
 use dependent manner 
5
 this is another way of describing neuroplasticity the
relatively recent discovery that neurons that fire together wire together when
a circuit fires repeatedly it can become a default setting the response most
likely to occur if you feel safe and loved your brain becomes specialized in
exploration play and cooperation if you are frightened and unwanted it
specializes in managing feelings of fear and abandonment 
as infants and toddlers we learn about the world by moving grabbing and

crawling and by discovering what happens when we cry smile or protest we
are constantly experimenting with our surroundings how do our interactions
change the way our bodies feel attend any two year old s birthday party and
notice how little kimberly will engage you play with you flirt with you 
without any need for language these early explorations shape the limbic
structures devoted to emotions and memory but these structures can also be
significantly modified by later experiences for the better by a close friendship or
a beautiful first love for example or for the worse by a violent assault relentless
bullying or neglect 
taken together the reptilian brain and limbic system make up what i ll call
the emotional brain throughout this book 
6
 the emotional brain is at the heart
of the central nervous system and its key task is to look out for your welfare if
it detects danger or a special opportunity such as a promising partner it alerts
you by releasing a squirt of hormones the resulting visceral sensations ranging
from mild queasiness to the grip of panic in your chest will interfere with
whatever your mind is currently focused on and get you moving physically and
mentally in a different direction even at their most subtle these sensations
have a huge influence on the small and large decisions we make throughout our
lives what we choose to eat where we like to sleep and with whom what music
we prefer whether we like to garden or sing in a choir and whom we befriend
and whom we detest 
the emotional brain s cellular organization and biochemistry are simpler
than those of the neocortex our rational brain and it assesses incoming
information in a more global way as a result it jumps to conclusions based on
rough similarities in contrast with the rational brain which is organized to sort
through a complex set of options the textbook example is leaping back in
terror when you see a snake only to realize that it s just a coiled rope the
emotional brain initiates preprogrammed escape plans like the fight or flight
responses these muscular and physiological reactions are automatic set in
motion without any thought or planning on our part leaving our conscious 
rational capacities to catch up later often well after the threat is over 
finally we reach the top layer of the brain the neocortex we share this
outer layer with other mammals but it is much thicker in us humans in the
second year of life the frontal lobes which make up the bulk of our neocortex 
begin to develop at a rapid pace the ancient philosophers called seven years
 the age of reason for us first grade is the prelude of things to come a life
organized around frontal lobe capacities sitting still keeping sphincters in

check being able to use words rather than acting out understanding abstract and
symbolic ideas planning for tomorrow and being in tune with teachers and
classmates 
the frontal lobes are responsible for the qualities that make us unique within
the animal kingdom 
7
 they enable us to use language and abstract thought they
give us our ability to absorb and integrate vast amounts of information and
attach meaning to it despite our excitement about the linguistic feats of
chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys only human beings command the words and
symbols necessary to create the communal spiritual and historical contexts that
shape our lives 
the frontal lobes allow us to plan and reflect to imagine and play out future
scenarios they help us to predict what will happen if we take one action like
applying for a new job or neglect another not paying the rent they make
choice possible and underlie our astonishing creativity generations of frontal
lobes working in close collaboration have created culture which got us from
dug out canoes horse drawn carriages and letters to jet planes hybrid cars and
e mail they also gave us noam s lifesaving trampoline 
mirroring each other interpersonal
neurobiology
crucial for understanding trauma the frontal lobes are also the seat of empathy
 our ability to feel into someone else one of the truly sensational
discoveries of modern neuroscience took place in 1994 when in a lucky accident
a group of italian scientists identified specialized cells in the cortex that came to
be known as mirror neurons 
8
 the researchers had attached electrodes to
individual neurons in a monkey s premotor area then set up a computer to
monitor precisely which neurons fired when the monkey picked up a peanut or
grasped a banana at one point an experimenter was putting food pellets into a
box when he looked up at the computer the monkey s brain cells were firing at
the exact location where the motor command neurons were located but the
monkey wasn t eating or moving he was watching the researcher and his brain
was vicariously mirroring the researcher s actions 
numerous other experiments followed around the world and it soon became
clear that mirror neurons explained many previously unexplainable aspects of
the mind such as empathy imitation synchrony and even the development of

language one writer compared mirror neurons to neural wifi 
9
 we pick up
not only another person s movement but her emotional state and intentions as
well when people are in sync with each other they tend to stand or sit similar
ways and their voices take on the same rhythms but our mirror neurons also
make us vulnerable to others negativity so that we respond to their anger with
fury or are dragged down by their depression i ll have more to say about mirror
neurons later in this book because trauma almost invariably involves not being
seen not being mirrored and not being taken into account treatment needs to
reactivate the capacity to safely mirror and be mirrored by others but also to
resist being hijacked by others negative emotions 
the triune three part brain 
 the brain develops from the bottom up the reptilian brain
develops in the womb and organizes basic life sustaining functions it is highly responsive to threat
throughout our entire life span the limbic system is organized mainly during the first six years of life
but continues to evolve in a use dependent manner trauma can have a major impact of its
functioning throughout life the prefrontal cortex develops last and also is affected by trauma
exposure including being unable to filter out irrelevant information throughout life it is vulnerable
to go off line in response to threat 
as anybody who has worked with brain damaged people or taken care of
demented parents has learned the hard way well functioning frontal lobes are
crucial for harmonious relationships with our fellow humans realizing that
other people can think and feel differently from us is a huge developmental step
for two and three year olds they learn to understand others motives so they
can adapt and stay safe in groups that have different perceptions expectations 

and values without flexible active frontal lobes people become creatures of
habit and their relationships become superficial and routine invention and
innovation discovery and wonder all are lacking 
our frontal lobes can also sometimes but not always stop us from doing
things that will embarrass us or hurt others we don t have to eat every time
we re hungry kiss anybody who rouses our desires or blow up every time we re
angry but it is exactly on that edge between impulse and acceptable behavior
where most of our troubles begin the more intense the visceral sensory input
from the emotional brain the less capacity the rational brain has to put a damper
on it 
identifying danger the cook and the smoke
detector
danger is a normal part of life and the brain is in charge of detecting it and
organizing our response sensory information about the outside world arrives
through our eyes nose ears and skin these sensations converge in the
thalamus an area inside the limbic system that acts as the cook within the
brain the thalamus stirs all the input from our perceptions into a fully blended
autobiographical soup an integrated coherent experience of this is what is
happening to me 
10
 the sensations are then passed on in two directions down
to the amygdala two small almond shaped structures that lie deeper in the
limbic unconscious brain and up to the frontal lobes where they reach our
conscious awareness the neuroscientist joseph ledoux calls the pathway to the
amygdala the low road which is extremely fast and that to the frontal cortex
the high road which takes several milliseconds longer in the midst of an
overwhelmingly threatening experience however processing by the thalamus
can break down sights sounds smells and touch are encoded as isolated 
dissociated fragments and normal memory processing disintegrates time
freezes so that the present danger feels like it will last forever 
the central function of the amygdala which i call the brain s smoke
detector is to identify whether incoming input is relevant for our survival 
11
 it
does so quickly and automatically with the help of feedback from the
hippocampus a nearby structure that relates the new input to past experiences if
the amygdala senses a threat a potential collision with an oncoming vehicle a
person on the street who looks threatening it sends an instant message down to

the hypothalamus and the brain stem recruiting the stress hormone system and
the autonomic nervous system ans to orchestrate a whole body response 
because the amygdala processes the information it receives from the thalamus
faster than the frontal lobes do it decides whether incoming information is a
threat to our survival even before we are consciously aware of the danger by the
time we realize what is happening our body may already be on the move 
the emotional brain has first dibs on interpreting incoming information 
 sensory information
about the environment and body state received by the eyes ears touch kinesthetic sense etc 
converges on the thalamus where it is processed and then passed on to the amygdala to interpret its
emotional significance this occurs with lightning speed if a threat is detected the amygdala sends
messages to the hypothalamus to secrete stress hormones to defend against that threat the
neuroscientist joseph ledoux calls this the low road the second neural pathway the high road runs
from the thalamus via the hippocampus and anterior cingulate to the prefrontal cortex the rational
brain for a conscious and much more refined interpretation this takes several microseconds longer 
if the interpretation of threat by the amygdala is too intense and or the filtering system from the
higher areas of the brain are too weak as often happens in ptsd people lose control over automatic
emergency responses like prolonged startle or aggressive outbursts 
the amygdala s danger signals trigger the release of powerful stress
hormones including cortisol and adrenaline which increase heart rate blood
pressure and rate of breathing preparing us to fight back or run away once the
danger is past the body returns to its normal state fairly quickly but when
recovery is blocked the body is triggered to defend itself which makes people

feel agitated and aroused 
while the smoke detector is usually pretty good at picking up danger clues 
trauma increases the risk of misinterpreting whether a particular situation is
dangerous or safe you can get along with other people only if you can
accurately gauge whether their intentions are benign or dangerous even a slight
misreading can lead to painful misunderstandings in relationships at home and at
work functioning effectively in a complex work environment or a household
filled with rambunctious kids requires the ability to quickly assess how people
are feeling and continuously adjusting your behavior accordingly faulty alarm
systems lead to blowups or shutdowns in response to innocuous comments or
facial expressions 
controlling the stress response the
watchtower
if the amygdala is the smoke detector in the brain think of the frontal lobes 
and specifically the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc 
12
 located directly above
our eyes as the watchtower offering a view of the scene from on high is that
smoke you smell the sign that your house is on fire and you need to get out fast
 or is it coming from the steak you put over too high a flame the amygdala
doesn t make such judgments it just gets you ready to fight back or escape even
before the frontal lobes get a chance to weigh in with their assessment as long
as you are not too upset your frontal lobes can restore your balance by helping
you realize that you are responding to a false alarm and abort the stress response 
ordinarily the executive capacities of the prefrontal cortex enable people to
observe what is going on predict what will happen if they take a certain action 
and make a conscious choice being able to hover calmly and objectively over
our thoughts feelings and emotions an ability i ll call mindfulness throughout
this book and then take our time to respond allows the executive brain to
inhibit organize and modulate the hardwired automatic reactions
preprogrammed into the emotional brain this capacity is crucial for preserving
our relationships with our fellow human beings as long as our frontal lobes are
working properly we re unlikely to lose our temper every time a waiter is late
with our order or an insurance company agent puts us on hold our watchtower
also tells us that other people s anger and threats are a function of 
their
emotional state when that system breaks down we become like conditioned

animals the moment we detect danger we automatically go into fight or flight
mode 
top down or bottom up 
 structures in the emotional brain decide what we perceive as dangerous or
safe there are two ways of changing the threat detection system from the top down via modulating
messages from the medial prefrontal cortex not just prefrontal cortex or from the bottom up via the
reptilian brain through breathing movement and touch 
in ptsd the critical balance between the amygdala smoke detector and the
mpfc watchtower shifts radically which makes it much harder to control
emotions and impulses neuroimaging studies of human beings in highly
emotional states reveal that intense fear sadness and anger all increase the
activation of subcortical brain regions involved in emotions and significantly
reduce the activity in various areas in the frontal lobe particularly the mpfc 
when that occurs the inhibitory capacities of the frontal lobe break down and
people take leave of their senses they may startle in response to any loud
sound become enraged by small frustrations or freeze when somebody touches
them 
13
effectively dealing with stress depends upon achieving a balance between

the smoke detector and the watchtower if you want to manage your emotions
better your brain gives you two options you can learn to regulate them from the
top down or from the bottom up 
knowing the difference between top down and bottom up regulation is
central for understanding and treating traumatic stress top down regulation
involves strengthening the capacity of the watchtower to monitor your body s
sensations mindfulness meditation and yoga can help with this bottom up
regulation involves recalibrating the autonomic nervous system which as we
have seen originates in the brain stem we can access the ans through breath 
movement or touch breathing is one of the few body functions under both
conscious and autonomic control in part 5 of this book we ll explore specific
techniques for increasing both top down and bottom up regulation 
the rider and the horse
for now i want to emphasize that emotion is not opposed to reason our
emotions assign value to experiences and thus are the foundation of reason our
self experience is the product of the balance between our rational and our
emotional brains when these two systems are in balance we feel like
ourselves however when our survival is at stake these systems can function
relatively independently 
if say you are driving along chatting with a friend and a truck suddenly
looms in the corner of your eye you instantly stop talking slam on the brakes 
and turn your steering wheel to get out of harm s way if your instinctive actions
have saved you from a collision you may resume where you left off whether
you are able to do so depends largely on how quickly your visceral reactions
subside to the threat 
the neuroscientist paul maclean who developed the three part description
of the brain that i ve used here compared the relationship between the rational
brain and the emotional brain to that between a more or less competent rider and
his unruly horse 
14
 as long as the weather is calm and the path is smooth the
rider can feel in excellent control but unexpected sounds or threats from other
animals can make the horse bolt forcing the rider to hold on for dear life 
likewise when people feel that their survival is at stake or they are seized by
rages longings fear or sexual desires they stop listening to the voice of reason 
and it makes little sense to argue with them whenever the limbic system decides

that something is a question of life or death the pathways between the frontal
lobes and the limbic system become extremely tenuous 
psychologists usually try to help people use insight and understanding to
manage their behavior however neuroscience research shows that very few
psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding most originate
in pressures from deeper regions in the brain that drive our perception and
attention when the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps signaling that you
are in danger no amount of insight will silence it i am reminded of the comedy
in which a seven time recidivist in an anger management program extols the
virtue of the techniques he s learned they are great and work terrific as long
as you are not really angry 
when our emotional and rational brains are in conflict as when we re
enraged with someone we love frightened by someone we depend on or lust
after someone who is off limits a tug of war ensues this war is largely played
out in the theater of visceral experience your gut your heart your lungs and
will lead to both physical discomfort and psychological misery chapter 6 will
discuss how the brain and viscera interact in safety and danger which is key to
understanding the many physical manifestations of trauma 
i d like to end this chapter by examining two more brain scans that illustrate
some of the core features of traumatic stress timeless reliving reexperiencing
images sounds and emotions and dissociation 
stan and ute s brains on trauma
on a fine september morning in 1999 stan and ute lawrence a professional
couple in their forties set out from their home in london ontario to attend a
business meeting in detroit halfway through the journey they ran into a wall of
dense fog that reduced visibility to zero in a split second stan immediately
slammed on the brakes coming to a standstill sideways on the highway just
missing a huge truck an eighteen wheeler went flying over the trunk of their
car vans and cars slammed into them and into each other people who got out of
their cars were hit as they ran for their lives the ear splitting crashes went on
and on with each jolt from behind they felt this would be the one that killed
them stan and ute were trapped in car number thirteen of an eighty seven car
pileup the worst road disaster in canadian history 
15
then came the eerie silence stan struggled to open the doors and windows 

but the eighteen wheeler that had crushed their trunk was wedged against the
car suddenly someone was pounding on their roof a girl was screaming get
me out of here i m on fire helplessly they saw her die as the car she d been
in was consumed by flames the next thing they knew a truck driver was
standing on the hood of their car with a fire extinguisher he smashed the
windshield to free them and stan climbed through the opening turning around
to help his wife he saw ute sitting frozen in her seat stan and the truck driver
lifted her out and an ambulance took them to an emergency room aside from a
few cuts they were found to be physically unscathed 
at home that night neither stan nor ute wanted to go to sleep they felt that
if they let go they would die they were irritable jumpy and on edge that
night and for many to come they drank copious quantities of wine to numb their
fear they could not stop the images that were haunting them or the questions
that went on and on what if they d left earlier what if they hadn t stopped for
gas after three months of this they sought help from dr ruth lanius a
psychiatrist at the university of western ontario 
dr lanius who had been my student at the trauma center a few years
earlier told stan and ute she wanted to visualize their brains with an fmri scan
before beginning treatment the fmri measures neural activity by tracking
changes in blood flow in the brain and unlike the pet scan it does not require
exposure to radiation dr lanius used the same kind of script driven imagery we
had used at harvard capturing the images sounds smells and other sensations
stan and ute had experienced while they were trapped in the car 
stan went first and immediately went into a flashback just as marsha had in
our harvard study he came out of the scanner sweating with his heart racing
and his blood pressure sky high this was just the way i felt during the
accident he reported i was sure i was going to die and there was nothing i
could do to save myself instead of remembering the accident as something that
had happened three months earlier stan was reliving it 
dissociation and reliving
dissociation is the essence of trauma the overwhelming experience is split off
and fragmented so that the emotions sounds images thoughts and physical
sensations related to the trauma take on a life of their own the sensory
fragments of memory intrude into the present where they are literally relived 
as long as the trauma is not resolved the stress hormones that the body secretes

to protect itself keep circulating and the defensive movements and emotional
responses keep getting replayed unlike stan however many people may not be
aware of the connection between their crazy feelings and reactions and the
traumatic events that are being replayed they have no idea why they respond to
some minor irritation as if they were about to be annihilated 
flashbacks and reliving are in some ways worse that the trauma itself a
traumatic event has a beginning and an end at some point it is over but for
people with ptsd a flashback can occur at any time whether they are awake or
asleep there is no way of knowing when it s going to occur again or how long it
will last people who suffer from flashbacks often organize their lives around
trying to protect against them they may compulsively go to the gym to pump
iron but finding that they are never strong enough numb themselves with
drugs or try to cultivate an illusory sense of control in highly dangerous
situations like motorcycle racing bungee jumping or working as an ambulance
driver constantly fighting unseen dangers is exhausting and leaves them
fatigued depressed and weary 
if elements of the trauma are replayed again and again the accompanying
stress hormones engrave those memories ever more deeply in the mind 
ordinary day to day events become less and less compelling not being able to
deeply take in what is going on around them makes it impossible to feel fully
alive it becomes harder to feel the joys and aggravations of ordinary life harder
to concentrate on the tasks at hand not being fully alive in the present keeps
them more firmly imprisoned in the past 
triggered responses manifest in various ways veterans may react to the
slightest cue like hitting a bump in the road or a seeing a kid playing in the
street as if they were in a war zone they startle easily and become enraged or
numb victims of childhood sexual abuse may anesthetize their sexuality and
then feel intensely ashamed if they become excited by sensations or images that
recall their molestation even when those sensations are the natural pleasures
associated with particular body parts if trauma survivors are forced to discuss
their experiences one person s blood pressure may increase while another
responds with the beginnings of a migraine headache still others may shut down
emotionally and not feel any obvious changes however in the lab we have no
problem detecting their racing hearts and the stress hormones churning through
their bodies 
these reactions are irrational and largely outside people s control intense
and barely controllable urges and emotions make people feel crazy and makes

them feel they don t belong to the human race feeling numb during birthday
parties for your kids or in response to the death of loved ones makes people feel
like monsters as a result shame becomes the dominant emotion and hiding the
truth the central preoccupation 
they are rarely in touch with the origins of their alienation that is where
therapy comes in is the beginning of bringing the emotions that were generated
by trauma being able to feel the capacity to observe oneself online however 
the bottom line is that the threat perception system of the brain has changed and
people s physical reactions are dictated by the imprint of the past 
the trauma that started out there is now played out on the battlefield of
their own bodies usually without a conscious connection between what
happened back then and what is going on right now inside the challenge is not
so much learning to accept the terrible things that have happened but learning
how to gain mastery over one s internal sensations and emotions sensing 
naming and identifying what is going on inside is the first step to recovery 
the smoke detector goes on overdrive
stan s brain scan shows his flashback in action this is what reliving trauma
looks like in the brain the brightly lit area in the lower right hand corner the
blanked out lower left side and the four symmetrical white holes around the
center you may recognize the lit up amygdala and the off line left brain from
the harvard study discussed in chapter 3 stan s amygdala made no distinction
between past and present it activated just as if the car crash were happening in
the scanner triggering powerful stress hormones and nervous system responses 
these were responsible for his sweating and trembling his racing heart and
elevated blood pressure entirely normal and potentially lifesaving responses if a
truck has just smashed into your car 

imaging a flashback with fmri 
 notice how much more activity appears on the right side than on
the left 
it s important to have an efficient smoke detector you don t want to get
caught unawares by a raging fire but if you go into a frenzy every time you
smell smoke it becomes intensely disruptive yes you need to detect whether
somebody is getting upset with you but if your amygdala goes into overdrive 
you may become chronically scared that people hate you or you may feel like
they are out to get you 
the timekeeper collapses
both stan and ute had become hypersensitive and irritable after the accident 
suggesting that their prefrontal cortex was struggling to maintain control in the
face of stress stan s flashback precipitated a more extreme reaction 
the two white areas in the front of the brain on top in the picture are the

right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when those areas are deactivated 
people lose their sense of time and become trapped in the moment without a
sense of past present or future 
16
two brain systems are relevant for the mental processing of trauma those
dealing with emotional intensity and context emotional intensity is defined by
the smoke alarm the amygdala and its counterweight the watchtower the
medial prefrontal cortex the context and meaning of an experience are
determined by the system that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
 dlpfc and the hippocampus the dlpfc is located to the side in the front
brain while the mpfc is in the center the structures along the midline of the
brain are devoted to your inner experience of yourself those on the side are
more concerned with your relationship with your surroundings 
the dlpfc tells us how our present experience relates to the past and how
it may affect the future you can think of it as the timekeeper of the brain 
knowing that whatever is happening is finite and will sooner or later come to an
end makes most experiences tolerable the opposite is also true situations
become intolerable if they feel interminable most of us know from sad personal
experience that terrible grief is typically accompanied by the sense that this
wretched state will last forever and that we will never get over our loss trauma
is the ultimate experience of this will last forever 
stan s scan reveals why people can recover from trauma only when the
brain structures that were knocked out during the original experience which is
why the event registered in the brain as trauma in the first place are fully
online visiting the past in therapy should be done while people are biologically
speaking firmly rooted in the present and feeling as calm safe and grounded as
possible grounded means that you can feel your butt in your chair see the
light coming through the window feel the tension in your calves and hear the
wind stirring the tree outside being anchored in the present while revisiting the
trauma opens the possibility of deeply knowing that the terrible events belong to
the past for that to happen the brain s watchtower cook and timekeeper need
to be online therapy won t work as long as people keep being pulled back into
the past 
the thalamus shuts down
look again at the scan of stan s flashback and you can see two more white

holes in the lower half of the brain these are his right and left thalamus 
blanked out during the flashback as they were during the original trauma as
i ve said the thalamus functions as a cook a relay station that collects
sensations from the ears eyes and skin and integrates them into the soup that is
our autobiographical memory breakdown of the thalamus explains why trauma
is primarily remembered not as a story a narrative with a beginning middle and
end but as isolated sensory imprints images sounds and physical sensations
that are accompanied by intense emotions usually terror and helplessness 
17
in normal circumstances the thalamus also acts as a filter or gatekeeper this
makes it a central component of attention concentration and new learning all
of which are compromised by trauma as you sit here reading you may hear
music in the background or traffic rumbling by or feel a faint gnawing in your
stomach telling you it s time for a snack if you are able to stay focused on this
page your thalamus is helping you distinguish between sensory information that
is relevant and information that you can safely ignore in chapter 19 on
neurofeedback i ll discuss some of the tests we use to measure how well this
gating system works as well as ways to strengthen it 
people with ptsd have their floodgates wide open lacking a filter they
are on constant sensory overload in order to cope they try to shut themselves
down and develop tunnel vision and hyperfocus if they can t shut down
naturally they may enlist drugs or alcohol to block out the world the tragedy is
that the price of closing down includes filtering out sources of pleasure and joy 
as well 
depersonalization split off from the self
let s now look at ute s experience in the scanner not all people react to trauma
in exactly the same way but in this case the difference is particularly dramatic 
since ute was sitting right next to stan in the wrecked car she responded to her
trauma script by going numb her mind went blank and nearly every area of her
brain showed markedly decreased activity her heart rate and blood pressure
didn t elevate when asked how she d felt during the scan she replied i felt
just like i felt at the time of the accident i felt nothing 

blanking out dissociation in response to being reminded of past trauma 
 in this case almost
every area of the brain has decreased activation interfering with thinking focus and orientation 
the medical term for ute s response is 
depersonalization
 
18
 anyone who
deals with traumatized men women or children is sooner or later confronted
with blank stares and absent minds the outward manifestation of the biological
freeze reaction depersonalization is one symptom of the massive dissociation
created by trauma stan s flashbacks came from his thwarted efforts to escape
the crash cued by the script all his dissociated fragmented sensations and
emotions roared back into the present but instead of struggling to escape ute
had dissociated her fear and felt nothing 
i see depersonalization regularly in my office when patients tell me
horrendous stories without any feeling all the energy drains out of the room 

and i have to make a valiant effort to keep paying attention a lifeless patient
forces you to work much harder to keep the therapy alive and i often used to
pray for the hour to be over quickly 
after seeing ute s scan i started to take a very different approach toward
blanked out patients with nearly every part of their brains tuned out they
obviously cannot think feel deeply remember or make sense out of what is
going on conventional talk therapy in those circumstances is virtually useless 
in ute s case it was possible to guess why she responded so differently from
stan she was utilizing a survival strategy her brain had learned in childhood to
cope with her mother s harsh treatment ute s father died when she was nine
years old and her mother subsequently was often nasty and demeaning to her at
some point ute discovered that she could blank out her mind when her mother
yelled at her thirty five years later when she was trapped in her demolished
car ute s brain automatically went into the same survival mode she made
herself disappear 
the challenge for people like ute is to become alert and engaged a difficult
but unavoidable task if they want to recapture their lives ute herself did
recover she wrote a book about her experiences and started a successful
journal called 
mental fitness
 this is where a bottom up approach to therapy
becomes essential the aim is actually to change the patient s physiology his or
her relationship to bodily sensations at the trauma center we work with such
basic measures as heart rate and breathing patterns we help patients evoke and
notice bodily sensations by tapping acupressure
19
 points rhythmic interactions
with other people are also effective tossing a beach ball back and forth 
bouncing on a pilates ball drumming or dancing to music 
numbing is the other side of the coin in ptsd many untreated trauma
survivors start out like stan with explosive flashbacks then numb out later in
life while reliving trauma is dramatic frightening and potentially self 
destructive over time a lack of presence can be even more damaging this is a
particular problem with traumatized children the acting out kids tend to get
attention the blanked out ones don t bother anybody and are left to lose their
future bit by bit 
learning to live in the present
the challenge of trauma treatment is not only dealing with the past but even

more enhancing the quality of day to day experience one reason that traumatic
memories become dominant in ptsd is that it s so difficult to feel truly alive
right now when you can t be fully here you go to the places where you did feel
alive even if those places are filled with horror and misery 
many treatment approaches for traumatic stress focus on desensitizing
patients to their past with the expectation that reexposure to their traumas will
reduce emotional outbursts and flashbacks i believe that this is based on a
misunderstanding of what happens in traumatic stress we must most of all help
our patients to live fully and securely in the present in order to do that we need
to help bring those brain structures that deserted them when they were
overwhelmed by trauma back desensitization may make you less reactive but if
you cannot feel satisfaction in ordinary everyday things like taking a walk 
cooking a meal or playing with your kids life will pass you by

body brain connections
life is about rhythm we vibrate our hearts are pumping blood we are
a rhythm machine that s what we are 
 mickey hart
oward the end of his career in 1872 charles darwin published 
the
expression of the emotions in man and animals 
1
 until recently most
scientific discussion of darwin s theories has focused on 
on
 
the origin of
species
 1859 and 
the descent of man
 1871 
 
but 
the
 
expression of the
emotions
 turns out to be an extraordinary exploration of the foundations of
emotional life filled with observations and anecdotes drawn from decades of
inquiry as well as close to home stories of darwin s children and household
pets it s also a landmark in book illustration one of the first books ever to
include photographs photography was still a relatively new technology and 
like most scientists darwin wanted to make use of the latest techniques to make
his points it s still in print today readily available in a recent edition with a
terrific introduction and commentaries by paul ekman a modern pioneer in the
study of emotions 
darwin starts his discussion by noting the physical organization common to
all mammals including human beings the lungs kidneys brains digestive
organs and sexual organs that sustain and continue life although many
scientists today would accuse him of anthropomorphism darwin stands with
animal lovers when he proclaims man and the higher animals also have
instincts in common all have the same senses intuition sensation passions 

affections and emotions even the more complex ones such as jealousy 
suspicion emulation gratitude and magnanimity 
2
 he observes that we humans
share some of the physical signs of animal emotion feeling the hair on the back
of your neck stand up when you re frightened or baring your teeth when you re
enraged can only be understood as vestiges of a long evolutionary process 


 when a man sneers or snarls at another is the corner of the canine or eye tooth raised on the side
facing the man whom he addresses 
 charles darwin 1872
for darwin mammalian emotions are fundamentally rooted in biology they
are the indispensable source of motivation to initiate action emotions from the
latin 
emovere
 to move out give shape and direction to whatever we do and
their primary expression is through the muscles of the face and body these
facial and physical movements communicate our mental state and intention to
others angry expressions and threatening postures caution them to back off 
sadness attracts care and attention fear signals helplessness or alerts us to
danger 
we instinctively read the dynamic between two people simply from their
tension or relaxation their postures and tone of voice their changing facial
expressions watch a movie in a language you don t know and you can still
guess the quality of the relationship between the characters we often can read
other mammals monkeys dogs horses in the same way 
darwin goes on to observe that the fundamental purpose of emotions is to
initiate movement that will restore the organism to safety and physical
equilibrium here is his comment on the origin of what today we would call
ptsd 

behaviors to avoid or escape from danger have clearly evolved to
render each organism competitive in terms of survival but
inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behavior would put the
animal at a disadvantage in that successful species preservation
demands reproduction which in turn depends upon feeding shelter and
mating activities all of which are reciprocals of avoidance and escape 
3
in other words if an organism is stuck in survival mode its energies are
focused on fighting off unseen enemies which leaves no room for nurture care 
and love for us humans it means that as long as the mind is defending itself
against invisible assaults our closest bonds are threatened along with our ability
to imagine plan play learn and pay attention to other people s needs 
darwin also wrote about body brain connections that we are still exploring
today intense emotions involve not only the mind but also the gut and the heart 
 heart guts and brain communicate intimately via the pneumogastric nerve 
the critical nerve involved in the expression and management of emotions in
both humans and animals when the mind is strongly excited it instantly affects
the state of the viscera so that under excitement there will be much mutual
action and reaction between these the two most important organs of the body 
4
the first time i encountered this passage i reread it with growing
excitement of course we experience our most devastating emotions as gut 
wrenching feelings and heartbreak as long as we register emotions primarily in
our heads we can remain pretty much in control but feeling as if our chest is
caving in or we ve been punched in the gut is unbearable we ll do anything to
make these awful visceral sensations go away whether it is clinging desperately
to another human being rendering ourselves insensible with drugs or alcohol or
taking a knife to the skin to replace overwhelming emotions with definable
sensations how many mental health problems from drug addiction to self 
injurious behavior start as attempts to cope with the unbearable physical pain of
our emotions if darwin was right the solution requires finding ways to help
people alter the inner sensory landscape of their bodies 
until recently this bidirectional communication between body and mind
was largely ignored by western science even as it had long been central to
traditional healing practices in many other parts of the world notably in india
and china today it is transforming our understanding of trauma and recovery 

a window into the nervous system
all of the little signs we instinctively register during a conversation the muscle
shifts and tensions in the other person s face eye movements and pupil dilation 
pitch and speed of the voice as well as the fluctuations in our own inner
landscape salivation swallowing breathing and heart rate are linked by a
single regulatory system 
5
 all are a product of the synchrony between the two
branches of the autonomic nervous system ans the sympathetic which acts
as the body s accelerator and the parasympathetic which serves as its brake 
6
these are the reciprocals darwin spoke of and working together they play an
important role in managing the body s energy flow one preparing for its
expenditure the other for its conservation 
the sympathetic nervous system sns is responsible for arousal including
the fight or flight response darwin s escape or avoidance behavior almost
two thousand years ago the roman physician galen gave it the name
 sympathetic because he observed that it functioned with the emotions 
sym
pathos
 the sns moves blood to the muscles for quick action partly by
triggering the adrenal glands to squirt out adrenaline which speeds up the heart
rate and increases blood pressure 
the second branch of the ans is the parasympathetic against emotions 
nervous system pns which promotes self preservative functions like digestion
and wound healing it triggers the release of acetylcholine to put a brake on
arousal slowing the heart down relaxing muscles and returning breathing to
normal as darwin pointed out feeding shelter and mating activities depend
on the pns 
there is a simple way to experience these two systems for yourself 
whenever you take a deep breath you activate the sns the resulting burst of
adrenaline speeds up your heart which explains why many athletes take a few
short deep breaths before starting competition exhaling in turn activates the
pns which slows down the heart if you take a yoga or a meditation class your
instructor will probably urge you to pay particular attention to the exhalation 
since deep long breaths out help calm you down as we breathe we continually
speed up and slow down the heart and because of that the interval between two
successive heartbeats is never precisely the same a measurement called heart
rate variability hrv can be used to test the flexibility of this system and good
hrv the more fluctuation the better is a sign that the brake and accelerator
in your arousal system are both functioning properly and in balance we had a

breakthrough when we acquired an instrument to measure hrv and i will
explain in chapter 16 how we can use hrv to help treat ptsd 
the neural love code
7
in 1994 stephen porges who was a researcher at the university of maryland at
the time we started our investigation of hrv and who is now at the university
of north carolina introduced the polyvagal theory which built on darwin s
observations and added another 140 years of scientific discoveries to those early
insights 
polyvagal
 refers to the many branches of the vagus nerve darwin s
 pneumogastric nerve which connects numerous organs including the brain 
lungs heart stomach and intestines the polyvagal theory provided us with a
more sophisticated understanding of the biology of safety and danger one based
on the subtle interplay between the visceral experiences of our own bodies and
the voices and faces of the people around us it explained why a kind face or a
soothing tone of voice can dramatically alter the way we feel it clarified why
knowing that we are seen and heard by the important people in our lives can
make us feel calm and safe and why being ignored or dismissed can precipitate
rage reactions or mental collapse it helped us understand why focused
attunement with another person can shift us out of disorganized and fearful
states 
8
in short porges s theory made us look beyond the effects of fight or flight
and put social relationships front and center in our understanding of trauma it
also suggested new approaches to healing that focus on strengthening the body s
system for regulating arousal 
human beings are astoundingly attuned to subtle emotional shifts in the
people and animals around them slight changes in the tension of the brow 
wrinkles around the eyes curvature of the lips and angle of the neck quickly
signal to us how comfortable suspicious relaxed or frightened someone is 
9
our mirror neurons register their inner experience and our own bodies make
internal adjustments to whatever we notice just so the muscles of our own faces
give others clues about how calm or excited we feel whether our heart is racing
or quiet and whether we re ready to pounce on them or run away when the
message we receive from another person is you re safe with me we relax if
we re lucky in our relationships we also feel nourished supported and restored
as we look into the face and eyes of the other 

our culture teaches us to focus on personal uniqueness but at a deeper level
we barely exist as individual organisms our brains are built to help us function
as members of a tribe we are part of that tribe even when we are by ourselves 
whether listening to music that other people created watching a basketball
game on television our own muscles tensing as the players run and jump or
preparing a spreadsheet for a sales meeting anticipating the boss s reactions 
most of our energy is devoted to connecting with others 
if we look beyond the list of specific symptoms that entail formal
psychiatric diagnoses we find that almost all mental suffering involves either
trouble in creating workable and satisfying relationships or difficulties in
regulating arousal as in the case of habitually becoming enraged shut down 
overexcited or disorganized usually it s a combination of both the standard
medical focus on trying to discover the right drug to treat a particular disorder 
tends to distract us from grappling with how our problems interfere with our
functioning as members of our tribe 
safety and reciprocity
a few years ago i heard jerome kagan a distinguished emeritus professor of
child psychology at harvard say to the dalai lama that for every act of cruelty
in this world there are hundreds of small acts of kindness and connection his
conclusion to be benevolent rather than malevolent is probably a true feature
of our species being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single
most important aspect of mental health safe connections are fundamental to
meaningful and satisfying lives numerous studies of disaster response around
the globe have shown that social support is the most powerful protection against
becoming overwhelmed by stress and trauma 
social support is not the same as merely being in the presence of others the
critical issue is 
reciprocity
 being truly heard and seen by the people around us 
feeling that we are held in someone else s mind and heart for our physiology to
calm down heal and grow we need a visceral feeling of safety no doctor can
write a prescription for friendship and love these are complex and hard earned
capacities you don t need a history of trauma to feel self conscious and even
panicked at a party with strangers but trauma can turn the whole world into a
gathering of aliens 
many traumatized people find themselves chronically out of sync with the
people around them some find comfort in groups where they can replay their

combat experiences rape or torture with others who have similar backgrounds
or experiences focusing on a shared history of trauma and victimization
alleviates their searing sense of isolation but usually at the price of having to
deny their individual differences members can belong only if they conform to
the common code 
isolating oneself into a narrowly defined victim group promotes a view of
others as irrelevant at best and dangerous at worst which eventually only leads
to further alienation gangs extremist political parties and religious cults may
provide solace but they rarely foster the mental flexibility needed to be fully
open to what life has to offer and as such cannot liberate their members from
their traumas well functioning people are able to accept individual differences
and acknowledge the humanity of others 
in the past two decades it has become widely recognized that when adults or
children are too skittish or shut down to derive comfort from human beings 
relationships with other mammals can help dogs and horses and even dolphins
offer less complicated companionship while providing the necessary sense of
safety dogs and horses in particular are now extensively used to treat some
groups of trauma patients 
10
three levels of safety
after trauma the world is experienced with a different nervous system that has
an altered perception of risk and safety porges coined the word neuroception 
to describe the capacity to evaluate relative danger and safety in one s
environment when we try to help people with faulty neuroception the great
challenge is finding ways to reset their physiology so that their survival
mechanisms stop working against them this means helping them to respond
appropriately to danger but even more to recover the capacity to experience
safety relaxation and true reciprocity 
i have extensively interviewed and treated six people who survived plane
crashes two reported having lost consciousness during the incident even
though they were not physically injured they collapsed mentally two went into
a panic and stayed frantic until well after we had started treatment two
remained calm and resourceful and helped evacuate fellow passengers from the
burning wreckage i ve found a similar range of responses in survivors of rape 
car crashes and torture in the previous chapter we saw the radically different

reactions of stan and ute as they relived the highway disaster they d
experienced side by side what accounts for this spectrum of responses focused 
collapsed or frantic 
porges s theory provides an explanation the autonomic nervous system
regulates three fundamental physiological states the level of safety determines
which one of these is activated at any particular time whenever we feel
threatened we instinctively turn to the first level 
social engagement
 we call out
for help support and comfort from the people around us but if no one comes to
our aid or we re in immediate danger the organism reverts to a more primitive
way to survive 
fight or flight 
 we fight off our attacker or we run to a safe
place however if this fails we can t get away we re held down or trapped 
the organism tries to preserve itself by shutting down and expending as little
energy as possible we are then in a state of 
freeze
 or 
collapse
 
this is where the many branched vagus nerve comes in and i ll describe its
anatomy briefly because it s central to understanding how people deal with
trauma the social engagement system depends on nerves that have their origin
in the brain stem regulatory centers primarily the vagus also known as the
tenth cranial nerve together with adjoining nerves that activate the muscles of
the face throat middle ear and voice box or larynx when the ventral vagal
complex vvc runs the show we smile when others smile at us we nod our
heads when we agree and we frown when friends tell us of their misfortunes 
when the vvc is engaged it also sends signals down to our heart and lungs 
slowing down our heart rate and increasing the depth of breathing as a result 
we feel calm and relaxed centered or pleasurably aroused 

the many branched vagus 
 the vagus nerve which darwin called the pneumogastric nerve 
registers heartbreak and gut wrenching feelings when a person becomes upset the throat gets dry 
the voice becomes tense the heart speeds up and respiration becomes rapid and shallow

three responses to threat 
1 
 the social engagement system an alarmed monkey signals danger and calls for help vvc 

2 
 fight or flight teeth bared the face of rage and terror sns 
3 
 collapse the body signals defeat and withdraws dvc 
any threat to our safety or social connections triggers changes in the areas
innervated by the vvc when something distressing happens we automatically
signal our upset in our facial expressions and tone of voice changes meant to
beckon others to come to our assistance 
11
 however if no one responds to our
call for help the threat increases and the older limbic brain jumps in the
sympathetic nervous system takes over mobilizing muscles heart and lungs for
fight or flight 
12
 our voice becomes faster and more strident and our heart starts
pumping faster if a dog is in the room she will stir and growl because she can
smell the activation of our sweat glands 
finally if there s no way out and there s nothing we can do to stave off the
inevitable we will activate the ultimate emergency system the dorsal vagal
complex dvc this system reaches down below the diaphragm to the
stomach kidneys and intestines and drastically reduces metabolism throughout
the body heart rate plunges we feel our heart drop we can t breathe and our
gut stops working or empties literally scaring the shit out of us this is the
point at which we disengage collapse and freeze 
fight or flight versus collapse
as we saw in stan s and ute s brain scans trauma is expressed not only as fight
or flight but also as shutting down and failing to engage in the present a
different level of brain activity is involved for each response the mammalian
fight or flight system which is protective and keeps us from shutting down and
the reptilian brain which produces the collapse response you can see the
difference between these two systems at any big pet store kittens puppies mice
and gerbils constantly play around and when they re tired they huddle together 
skin to skin in a pile in contrast the snakes and lizards lie motionless in the
corners of their cages unresponsive to the environment 
13
 this sort of
immobilization generated by the reptilian brain characterizes many chronically
traumatized people as opposed to the mammalian panic and rage that make
more recent trauma survivors so frightened and frightening 
almost everyone knows what that quintessential fight flight response road
rage feels like a sudden threat precipitates an intense impulse to move and
attack danger turns off our social engagement system decreases our

responsiveness to the human voice and increases our sensitivity to threatening
sounds yet for many people panic and rage are preferable to the opposite 
shutting down and becoming dead to the world activating flight flight at least
makes them feel energized that is why so many abused and traumatized people
feel fully alive in the face of actual danger while they go numb in situations that
are more complex but objectively safe like birthday parties or family dinners 
when fighting or running does not take care of the threat we activate the
last resort the reptilian brain the ultimate emergency system this system is
most likely to engage when we are physically immobilized as when we are
pinned down by an attacker or when a child has no escape from a terrifying
caregiver collapse and disengagement are controlled by the dvc an
evolutionarily ancient part of the parasympathetic nervous system that is
associated with digestive symptoms like diarrhea and nausea it also slows down
the heart and induces shallow breathing once this system takes over other
people and we ourselves cease to matter awareness is shut down and we may
no longer even register physical pain 
how we become human
in porges s grand theory the vvc evolved in mammals to support an
increasingly complex social life all mammals including human beings band
together to mate nurture their young defend against common enemies and
coordinate hunting and food acquisition the more efficiently the vvc
synchronizes the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
systems the better the physiology of each individual will be attuned to that of
other members of the tribe 
thinking about the vvc in this way illuminates how parents naturally help
their kids to regulate themselves newborn babies are not very social they sleep
most of the time and wake up when they re hungry or wet after having been fed
they may spend a little time looking around fussing or staring but they will
soon be asleep again following their own internal rhythms early in life they are
pretty much at the mercy of the alternating tides of their sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems and their reptilian brain runs most of the
show 
but day by day as we coo and smile and cluck at them we stimulate the
growth of synchronicity in the developing vvc these interactions help to bring
our babies emotional arousal systems into sync with their surroundings the

vvc controls sucking swallowing facial expression and the sounds produced
by the larynx when these functions are stimulated in an infant they are
accompanied by a sense of pleasure and safety which helps create the
foundation for all future social behavior 
14
 as my friend ed tronick taught me a
long time ago the brain is a cultural organ experience shapes the brain 
being in tune with other members of our species via the vvc is enormously
rewarding what begins as the attuned play of mother and child continues with
the rhythmicity of a good basketball game the synchrony of tango dancing and
the harmony of choral singing or playing a piece of jazz or chamber music all
of which foster a deep sense of pleasure and connection 
we can speak of trauma when that system fails when you beg for your life 
but the assailant ignores your pleas when you are a terrified child lying in bed 
hearing your mother scream as her boyfriend beats her up when you see your
buddy trapped under a piece of metal that you re not strong enough to lift when
you want to push away the priest who is abusing you but you re afraid you ll be
punished immobilization is at the root of most traumas when that occurs the
dvc is likely to take over your heart slows down your breathing becomes
shallow and zombielike you lose touch with yourself and your surroundings 
you dissociate faint and collapse 
defend or relax 
steve porges helped me realize that the natural state of mammals is to be
somewhat on guard however in order to feel emotionally close to another
human being our defensive system must temporarily shut down in order to
play mate and nurture our young the brain needs to turn off its natural
vigilance 
many traumatized individuals are too hypervigilant to enjoy the ordinary
pleasures that life has to offer while others are too numb to absorb new
experiences or to be alert to signs of real danger when the smoke detectors of
the brain malfunction people no longer run when they should be trying to escape
or fight back when they should be defending themselves the landmark ace
 adverse childhood experiences study which i ll discuss in more detail in
chapter 9 showed that women who had an early history of abuse and neglect
were seven times more likely to be raped in adulthood women who as children 
had witnessed their mothers being assaulted by their partners had a vastly

increased chance to fall victim to domestic violence 
15
many people feel safe as long as they can limit their social contact to
superficial conversations but actual physical contact can trigger intense
reactions however as porges points out achieving any sort of deep intimacy a
close embrace sleeping with a mate and sex requires allowing oneself to
experience immobilization without fear 
16
 it is especially challenging for
traumatized people to discern when they are actually safe and to be able to
activate their defenses when they are in danger this requires having experiences
that can restore the sense of physical safety a topic to which we ll return many
times in the chapters that follow 
new approaches to treatment
if we understand that traumatized children and adults get stuck in fight flight or
in chronic shutdown how do we help them to deactivate these defensive
maneuvers that once ensured their survival 
some gifted people who work with trauma survivors know how to do this
intuitively steve gross used to run the play program at the trauma center steve
often walked around the clinic with a brightly colored beach ball and when he
saw angry or frozen kids in the waiting room he would flash them a big smile 
the kids rarely responded then a little later he would return and accidentally 
drop his ball close to where a kid was sitting as steve leaned over to pick it up 
he d nudge it gently toward the kid who d usually give a halfhearted push in
return gradually steve got a back and forth going and before long you d see
smiles on both faces 
from simple rhythmically attuned movements steve had created a small 
safe place where the social engagement system could begin to reemerge in the
same way severely traumatized people may get more out of simply helping to
arrange chairs before a meeting or joining others in tapping out a musical rhythm
on the chair seats than they would from sitting in those same chairs and
discussing the failures in their life 
one thing is certain yelling at someone who is already out of control can
only lead to further dysregulation just as your dog cowers if you shout and wags
his tail when you speak in a high singsong we humans respond to harsh voices
with fear anger or shutdown and to playful tones by opening up and relaxing 
we simply cannot help but respond to these indicators of safety or danger 

sadly our educational system as well as many of the methods that profess
to treat trauma tend to bypass this emotional engagement system and focus
instead on recruiting the cognitive capacities of the mind despite the well 
documented effects of anger fear and anxiety on the ability to reason many
programs continue to ignore the need to engage the safety system of the brain
before trying to promote new ways of thinking the last things that should be cut
from school schedules are chorus physical education recess and anything else
involving movement play and joyful engagement when children are
oppositional defensive numbed out or enraged it s also important to recognize
that such bad behavior may repeat action patterns that were established to
survive serious threats even if they are intensely upsetting or off putting 
porges s work has had a profound effect on how my trauma center
colleagues and i organize the treatment of abused children and traumatized
adults it s true that we would probably have developed a therapeutic yoga
program for women at some point given that yoga had proved so successful in
helping them calm down and get in touch with their dissociated bodies we
would also have been likely to experiment with a theater program in the boston
inner city schools with a karate program for rape survivors called impact model
mugging and with play techniques and body modalities like sensory stimulation
that have now been used with survivors around the world all of these and more
will be explored in part 5 
but the polyvagal theory helped us understand and explain 
why
 all these
disparate unconventional techniques worked so well it enabled us to become
more conscious of combining top down approaches to activate social
engagement with bottom up methods to calm the physical tensions in the
body we were more open to the value of other age old nonpharmacological
approaches to health that have long been practiced outside western medicine 
ranging from breath exercises pranayama and chanting to martial arts like
qigong to drumming and group singing and dancing all rely on interpersonal
rhythms visceral awareness and vocal and facial communication which help
shift people out of fight flight states reorganize their perception of danger and
increase their capacity to manage relationships 
the body keeps the score 
17
 if the memory of trauma is encoded in the
viscera in heartbreaking and gut wrenching emotions in autoimmune disorders
and skeletal muscular problems and if mind brain visceral communication is the
royal road to emotion regulation this demands a radical shift in our therapeutic
assumptions

 rainer maria rilke 
letters to a young poet
herry walked into my office with her shoulders slumped
 
 her chin nearly
touching her chest even before we spoke a word her body was telling me
that she was afraid to face the world i also noticed that her long sleeves only
partially covered the scabs on her forearms after sitting down she told me in a
high pitched monotone that she couldn t stop herself from picking at the skin on
her arms and chest until she bled 
as far back as sherry could remember her mother had run a foster home 
and their house was often packed with as many as fifteen strange disruptive 
frightened and frightening kids who disappeared as suddenly as they arrived 
sherry had grown up taking care of these transient children feeling that there
was no room for her and her needs i know i wasn t wanted she told me i m
not sure when i first realized that but i ve thought about things that my mother
said to me and the signs were always there she d tell me you know i don t
think you belong in this family i think they gave us the wrong baby and she d
say it with a smile on her face but of course people often pretend to joke when
they say something serious 

over the years our research team has repeatedly found that chronic
emotional abuse and neglect can be just as devastating as physical abuse and
sexual molestation 
1
 sherry turned out to be a living example of these findings 
not being seen not being known and having nowhere to turn to feel safe is
devastating at any age but it is particularly destructive for young children who
are still trying to find their place in the world 
sherry had graduated from college but she now worked in a joyless clerical
job lived alone with her cats and had no close friends when i asked her about
men she told me that her only relationship had been with a man who d
kidnapped her while she was on a college vacation in florida he d held her
captive and raped her repeatedly for five consecutive days she remembered
having been curled up terrified and frozen for most of that time until she
realized she could try to get away she escaped by simply walking out while he
was in the bathroom when she called her mother collect for help her mother
refused to take the call sherry finally managed to get home with assistance from
a domestic violence shelter 
sherry told me that she d started to pick at her skin because it gave her some
relief from feeling numb the physical sensations made her feel more alive but
also deeply ashamed she knew she was addicted to these actions but could not
stop them she d consulted many mental health professionals before me and had
been questioned repeatedly about her suicidal behavior she d also been
subjected to involuntary hospitalization by a psychiatrist who refused to treat her
unless she could promise that she would never pick at herself again however in
my experience patients who cut themselves or pick at their skin like sherry are
seldom suicidal but are trying to make themselves feel better in the only way
they know 
this is a difficult concept for many people to understand as i discussed in
the previous chapter the most common response to distress is to seek out people
we like and trust to help us and give us the courage to go on we may also calm
down by engaging in a physical activity like biking or going to the gym we start
learning these ways of regulating our feelings from the first moment someone
feeds us when we re hungry covers us when we re cold or rocks us when we re
hurt or scared 
but if no one has ever looked at you with loving eyes or broken out in a
smile when she sees you if no one has rushed to help you but instead said 
 stop crying or i ll give you something to cry about then you need to
discover other ways of taking care of yourself you are likely to experiment with

anything drugs alcohol binge eating or cutting that offers some kind of
relief 
while sherry dutifully came to every appointment and answered my
questions with great sincerity i did not feel we were making the sort of vital
connection that is necessary for therapy to work struck by how frozen and
uptight she was i suggested that she see liz a massage therapist i had worked
with previously during their first meeting liz positioned sherry on the massage
table then moved to the end of the table and gently held sherry s feet lying
there with her eyes closed sherry suddenly yelled in a panic where are you 
somehow sherry had lost track of liz even though liz was right there with her
hands on sherry s feet 
sherry was one of the first patients who taught me about the extreme
disconnection from the body that so many people with histories of trauma and
neglect experience i discovered that my professional training with its focus on
understanding and insight had largely ignored the relevance of the living 
breathing body the foundation of our selves sherry knew that picking her skin
was a destructive thing to do and that it was related to her mother s neglect but
understanding the source of the impulse made no difference in helping her
control it 
losing your body
once i was alerted to this i was amazed to discover how many of my patients
told me they could not feel whole areas of their bodies sometimes i d ask them
to close their eyes and tell me what i had put into their outstretched hands 
whether it was a car key a quarter or a can opener they often could not even
guess what they were holding their sensory perceptions simply weren t
working 
i talked this over with my friend alexander mcfarlane in australia who
had observed the same phenomenon in his laboratory in adelaide he had
studied the question how do we know without looking at it that we re holding a
car key recognizing an object in the palm of your hand requires sensing its
shape weight temperature texture and position each of those distinct sensory
experiences is transmitted to a different part of the brain which then needs to
integrate them into a single perception mcfarlane found that people with ptsd
often have trouble putting the picture together 
2

when our senses become muffled we no longer feel fully alive in an article
called what is an emotion 1884 
3
 william james the father of american
psychology reported a striking case of sensory insensibility in a woman he
interviewed i have no human sensations she told him i am surrounded
by all that can render life happy and agreeable still to me the faculty of
enjoyment and of feeling is wanting each of my senses each part of my
proper self is as it were separated from me and can no longer afford me any
feeling this impossibility seems to depend upon a void which i feel in the front
of my head and to be due to the diminution of the sensibility over the whole
surface of my body for it seems to me that i never actually reach the objects
which i touch all this would be a small matter enough but for its frightful
result which is that of the impossibility of any other kind of feeling and of any
sort of enjoyment although i experience a need and desire of them that render
my life an incomprehensible torture 
this response to trauma raises an important question how can traumatized
people learn to integrate ordinary sensory experiences so that they can live with
the natural flow of feeling and feel secure and complete in their bodies 
how do we know we re alive 
most early neuroimaging studies of traumatized people were like those we ve
seen in chapter 3 they focused on how subjects reacted to specific reminders of
the trauma then in 2004 my colleague ruth lanius who scanned stan and ute
lawrence s brains posed a new question what happens in the brains of trauma
survivors when they are 
not
 thinking about the past her studies on the idling
brain the default state network dsn opened up a whole new chapter in
understanding how trauma affects self awareness specifically sensory self 
awareness 
4
dr lanius recruited a group of sixteen normal canadians to lie in a brain
scanner while thinking about nothing in particular this is not easy for anyone to
do as long as we are awake our brains are churning but she asked them to
focus their attention on their breathing and try to empty their minds as much as
possible she then repeated the same experiment with eighteen people who had
histories of severe chronic childhood abuse 
what is your brain doing when you have nothing in particular on your
mind it turns out that you pay attention to yourself the default state activates

the brain areas that work together to create your sense of self 
when ruth looked at the scans of her normal subjects she found activation
of dsn regions that previous researchers had described i like to call this the
mohawk of self awareness the midline structures of the brain starting out right
above our eyes running through the center of the brain all the way to the back 
all these midline structures are involved in our sense of self the largest bright
region at the back of the brain is the posterior cingulate which gives us a
physical sense of where we are our internal gps it is strongly connected to the
medial prefrontal cortex mpfc the watchtower i discussed in chapter 4 this
connection doesn t show up on the scan because the fmri can t measure it it is
also connected with brain areas that register sensations coming from the rest of
the body the insula which relays messages from the viscera to the emotional
centers the parietal lobes which integrate sensory information and the anterior
cingulate which coordinates emotions and thinking all of these areas contribute
to consciousness 


locating the self 
 the mohawk of self awareness starting from the front of the brain at right this
consists of the orbital prefrontal cortex the medial prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate the
posterior cingulate and the insula in individuals with histories of chronic trauma the same regions
show sharply decreased activity making it difficult to register internal states and assessing the
personal relevance of incoming information 
the contrast with the scans of the eighteen chronic ptsd patients with
severe early life trauma was startling there was almost no activation of any of
the self sensing areas of the brain the mpfc the anterior cingulate the parietal
cortex and the insula did not light up at all the only area that showed a slight
activation was the posterior cingulate which is responsible for basic orientation
in space 
there could be only one explanation for such results in response to the
trauma itself and in coping with the dread that persisted long afterward these
patients had learned to shut down the brain areas that transmit the visceral
feelings and emotions that accompany and define terror yet in everyday life 
those same brain areas are responsible for registering the entire range of
emotions and sensations that form the foundation of our self awareness our
sense of who we are what we witnessed here was a tragic adaptation in an
effort to shut off terrifying sensations they also deadened their capacity to feel
fully alive 
the disappearance of medial prefrontal activation could explain why so
many traumatized people lose their sense of purpose and direction i used to be
surprised by how often my patients asked me for advice about the most ordinary
things and then by how rarely they followed it now i understood that their
relationship with their own inner reality was impaired how could they make

decisions or put any plan into action if they couldn t define what they wanted
or to be more precise what the sensations in their bodies the basis of all
emotions were trying to tell them 
the lack of self awareness in victims of chronic childhood trauma is
sometimes so profound that they cannot recognize themselves in a mirror brain
scans show that this is not the result of mere inattention the structures in charge
of self recognition may be knocked out along with the structures related to self 
experience 
when ruth lanius showed me her study a phrase from my classical high
school education came back to me the mathematician archimedes teaching
about the lever is supposed to have said give me a place to stand and i will
move the world or as the great twentieth century body therapist moshe
feldenkrais put it you can t do what you want till you know what you re
doing the implications are clear to feel present you have to know where you
are and be aware of what is going on with you if the self sensing system breaks
down we need to find ways to reactivate it 
the self sensing system
it was fascinating to see how much sherry benefited from her massage therapy 
she felt more relaxed and adventurous in her day to day life and she was also
more relaxed and open with me she became truly involved in her therapy and
was genuinely curious about her behavior thoughts and feelings she stopped
picking at her skin and when summer came she started to spend evenings sitting
outside on her stoop chatting with her neighbors she even joined a church
choir a wonderful experience of group synchrony 
it was at about this time that i met antonio damasio at a small think tank
that dan schacter the chair of the psychology department at harvard had
organized in a series of brilliant scientific articles and books damasio clarified
the relationship among body states emotions and survival a neurologist who
has treated hundreds of people with various forms of brain damage he became
fascinated with consciousness and with identifying the areas of the brain
necessary for knowing what you feel he has devoted his career to mapping out
what is responsible for our experience of self 
the feeling of what happens
is for me his most important book and reading it was a revelation 
5
 damasio
starts by pointing out the deep divide between our sense of self and the sensory

life of our bodies as he poetically explains sometimes we use our minds not
to discover facts but to hide them one of the things the screen hides most
effectively is the body our own body by which i mean the ins of it its interiors 
like a veil thrown over the skin to secure its modesty the screen partially
removes from the mind the inner states of the body those that constitute the flow
of life as it wanders in the journey of each day 
6
he goes on to describe how this screen can work in our favor by enabling
us to attend to pressing problems in the outside world yet it has a cost it tends
to prevent us from sensing the possible origin and nature of what we call self 
7
building on the century old work of william james damasio argues that the
core of our self awareness rests on the physical sensations that convey the inner
states of the body 
 p rimordial feelings provide a direct experience of one s own living
body wordless unadorned and connected to nothing but sheer
existence these primordial feelings reflect the current state of the body
along varied dimensions along the scale that ranges from pleasure
to pain and they originate at the level of the brain stem rather than the
cerebral cortex all feelings of emotion are complex musical variations
on primordial feelings 
8
our sensory world takes shape even before we are born in the womb we
feel amniotic fluid against our skin we hear the faint sounds of rushing blood
and a digestive tract at work we pitch and roll with our mother s movements 
after birth physical sensation defines our relationship to ourselves and to our
surroundings we start off 
being 
our wetness hunger satiation and sleepiness a
cacophony of incomprehensible sounds and images presses in on our pristine
nervous system even after we acquire consciousness and language our bodily
sensing system provides crucial feedback on our moment to moment condition 
its constant hum communicates changes in our viscera and in the muscles of our
face torso and extremities that signal pain and comfort as well as urges such as
hunger and sexual arousal what is taking place around us also affects our
physical sensations seeing someone we recognize hearing particular sounds a
piece of music a siren or sensing a shift in temperature all change our focus of
attention and without our being aware of it prime our subsequent thoughts and
actions 

as we have seen the job of the brain is to constantly monitor and evaluate
what is going on within and around us these evaluations are transmitted by
chemical messages in the bloodstream and electrical messages in our nerves 
causing subtle or dramatic changes throughout the body and brain these shifts
usually occur entirely without conscious input or awareness the subcortical
regions of the brain are astoundingly efficient in regulating our breathing 
heartbeat digestion hormone secretion and immune system however these
systems can become overwhelmed if we are challenged by an ongoing threat or
even the perception of threat this accounts for the wide array of physical
problems researchers have documented in traumatized people 
yet our conscious self also plays a vital role in maintaining our inner
equilibrium we need to register and act on our physical sensations to keep our
bodies safe realizing we re cold compels us to put on a sweater feeling hungry
or spacey tells us our blood sugar is low and spurs us to get a snack the pressure
of a full bladder sends us to the bathroom damasio points out that all of the
brain structures that register background feelings are located near areas that
control basic housekeeping functions such as breathing appetite elimination 
and sleep wake cycles this is because the consequences of having emotion and
attention are entirely related to the fundamental business of managing life within
the organism it is not possible to manage life and maintain homeostatic balance
without data on the current state of the organism s body 
9
 damasio calls these
housekeeping areas of the brain the proto self because they create the
 wordless knowledge that underlies our conscious sense of self 
the self under threat
in 2000 damasio and his colleagues published an article in the world s foremost
scientific publication 
science
 which reported that reliving a strong negative
emotion causes significant changes in the brain areas that receive nerve signals
from the muscles gut and skin areas that are crucial for regulating basic
bodily functions the team s brain scans showed that recalling an emotional
event from the past causes us to actually reexperience the visceral sensations felt
during the original event each type of emotion produced a characteristic pattern 
distinct from the others for example a particular part of the brain stem was
 active in sadness and anger but not in happiness or fear 
10
 all of these brain
regions are below the limbic system to which emotions are traditionally

assigned yet we acknowledge their involvement every time we use one of the
common expressions that link strong emotions with the body you make me
sick it made my skin crawl i was all choked up my heart sank he
makes me bristle 
the elementary self system in the brain stem and limbic system is massively
activated when people are faced with the threat of annihilation which results in
an overwhelming sense of fear and terror accompanied by intense physiological
arousal to people who are reliving a trauma nothing makes sense they are
trapped in a life or death situation a state of paralyzing fear or blind rage mind
and body are constantly aroused as if they are in imminent danger they startle
in response to the slightest noises and are frustrated by small irritations their
sleep is chronically disturbed and food often loses its sensual pleasures this in
turn can trigger desperate attempts to shut those feelings down by freezing and
dissociation 
11
how do people regain control when their animal brains are stuck in a fight
for survival if what goes on deep inside our animal brains dictates how we feel 
and if our body sensations are orchestrated by subcortical subconscious brain
structures how much control over them can we actually have 
agency owning your life
 agency is the technical term for the feeling of being in charge of your life 
knowing where you stand knowing that you have a say in what happens to you 
knowing that you have some ability to shape your circumstances the veterans
who put their fists through drywall at the va were trying to assert their agency 
to make something happen but they ended up feeling even more out of control 
and many of these once confident men were trapped in a cycle between frantic
activity and immobility 
agency starts with what scientists call interoception our awareness of our
subtle sensory body based feelings the greater that awareness the greater our
potential to control our lives knowing 
what
 we feel is the first step to knowing
why
 we feel that way if we are aware of the constant changes in our inner and
outer environment
 
 we can mobilize to manage them but we can t do this unless
our watchtower the mpfc learns to observe what is going on inside us this is
why mindfulness practice which strengthens the mpfc is a cornerstone of
recovery from trauma 
12

after i saw the wonderful movie 
march of the penguins
 i found myself
thinking about some of my patients the penguins are stoic and endearing and
it s tragic to learn how from time immemorial they have trudged seventy miles
inland from the sea endured indescribable hardships to reach their breeding
grounds lost numerous viable eggs to exposure and then almost starving 
dragged themselves back to the ocean if penguins had our frontal lobes they
would have used their little flippers to build igloos devised a better division of
labor and reorganized their food supplies many of my patients have survived
trauma through tremendous courage and persistence only to get into the same
kinds of trouble over and over again trauma has shut down their inner compass
and robbed them of the imagination they need to create something better 
the neuroscience of selfhood and agency validates the kinds of somatic
therapies that my friends peter levine
13
 and pat ogden
14
 have developed i ll
discuss these and other sensorimotor approaches in more detail in part v but in
essence their aim is threefold 
to draw out the sensory information that is blocked and frozen by
trauma 
to help patients befriend rather than suppress the energies released
by that inner experience 
to complete the self preserving physical actions that were thwarted
when they were trapped restrained or immobilized by terror 
our gut feelings signal what is safe life sustaining or threatening even if
we cannot quite explain why we feel a particular way our sensory interiority
continuously sends us subtle messages about the needs of our organism gut
feelings also help us to evaluate what is going on around us they warn us that
the guy who is approaching feels creepy but they also convey that a room with
western exposure surrounded by daylilies makes us feel serene if you have a
comfortable connection with your inner sensations if you can trust them to
give you accurate information you will feel in charge of your body your
feelings and your self 
however traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies 
the past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort their bodies are
constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs and in an attempt to control
these processes they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in
numbing awareness of what is played out inside they learn to hide from their

selves 
the more people try to push away and ignore internal warning signs the
more likely they are to take over and leave them bewildered confused and
ashamed people who cannot comfortably notice what is going on inside become
vulnerable to respond to any sensory shift either by shutting down or by going
into a panic they develop a fear of fear itself 
we now know that panic symptoms are maintained largely because the
individual develops a fear of the bodily sensations associated with panic attacks 
the attack may be triggered by something he or she knows is irrational but fear
of the sensations keeps them escalating into a full body emergency scared
stiff and frozen in fear collapsing and going numb describe precisely what
terror and trauma feel like they are its visceral foundation the experience of
fear derives from primitive responses to threat where escape is thwarted in some
way people s lives will be held hostage to fear until that visceral experience
changes 
the price for ignoring or distorting the body s messages is being unable to
detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and just as bad what is safe or
nourishing self regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your
body without it you have to rely on external regulation from medication 
drugs like alcohol constant reassurance or compulsive compliance with the
wishes of others 
many of my patients respond to stress not by noticing and naming it but by
developing migraine headaches or asthma attacks 
15
 sandy a middle aged
visiting nurse told me she d felt terrified and lonely as a child unseen by her
alcoholic parents she dealt with this by becoming deferential to everybody she
depended on including me her therapist whenever her husband made an
insensitive remark she would come down with an asthma attack by the time
she noticed that she couldn t breathe it was too late for an inhaler to be
effective and she had to be taken to the emergency room 
suppressing our inner cries for help does not stop our stress hormones from
mobilizing the body even though sandy had learned to ignore her relationship
problems and block out her physical distress signals they showed up in
symptoms that demanded her attention her therapy focused on identifying the
link between her physical sensations and her emotions and i also encouraged
her to enroll in a kickboxing program she had no emergency room visits during
the three years she was my patient 
somatic symptoms for which no clear physical basis can be found are

ubiquitous in traumatized children and adults they can include chronic back
and neck pain fibromyalgia migraines digestive problems spastic
colon irritable bowel syndrome chronic fatigue and some forms of asthma 
16
traumatized children have fifty times the rate of asthma as their nontraumatized
peers 
17
 studies have shown that many children and adults with fatal asthma
attacks were not aware of having breathing problems before the attacks 
alexithymia no words for feelings
i had a widowed aunt with a painful trauma history who became an honorary
grandmother to our children she came on frequent visits that were marked by
much doing making curtains rearranging kitchen shelves sewing children s
clothes and very little talking she was always eager to please but it was
difficult to figure out what 
she
 enjoyed after several days of exchanging
pleasantries conversation would come to a halt and i d have to work hard to fill
the long silences on the last day of her visits i d drive her to the airport where
she d give me a stiff good bye hug while tears streamed down her face without
a trace of irony she d then complain that the cold wind at logan international
airport made her eyes water her body felt the sadness that her mind couldn t
register she was leaving our young family her closest living relatives 
psychiatrists call this phenomenon alexithymia greek for not having
words for feelings many traumatized children and adults simply cannot describe
what they are feeling because they cannot identify what their physical sensations
mean they may look furious but deny that they are angry they may appear
terrified but say that they are fine not being able to discern what is going on
inside their bodies causes them to be out of touch with their needs and they have
trouble taking care of themselves whether it involves eating the right amount at
the right time or getting the sleep they need 
like my aunt alexithymics substitute the language of action for that of
emotion when asked how would you feel if you saw a truck coming at you at
eighty miles per hour most people would say i d be terrified or i d be
frozen with fear an alexithymic might reply how would i feel i don t
know i d get out of the way 
18
 they tend to register emotions as physical
problems rather than as signals that something deserves their attention instead
of feeling angry or sad they experience muscle pain bowel irregularities or
other symptoms for which no cause can be found about three quarters of

patients with anorexia nervosa and more than half of all patients with bulimia 
are bewildered by their emotional feelings and have great difficulty describing
them 
19
 when researchers showed pictures of angry or distressed faces to people
with alexithymia they could not figure out what those people were feeling 
20
one of the first people who taught me about alexithymia was the
psychiatrist henry krystal who worked with more than a thousand holocaust
survivors in his effort to understand massive psychic trauma 
21
 krystal himself a
concentration camp survivor found that many of his patients were professionally
successful but their intimate relationships were bleak and distant suppressing
their feelings had made it possible to attend to the business of the world but at a
price they learned to shut down their once overwhelming emotions and as a
result they no longer recognized what they were feeling few of them had any
interest in therapy 
paul frewen at the university of western ontario did a series of brain scans
of people with ptsd who suffered from alexithymia one of the participants
told him i don t know what i feel it s like my head and body aren t connected 
i m living in a tunnel a fog no matter what happens it s the same reaction 
numbness nothing having a bubble bath and being burned or raped is the same
feeling my brain doesn t feel frewen and his colleague ruth lanius found
that the more people were out of touch with their feelings the less activity they
had in the self sensing areas of the brain 
22
because traumatized people often have trouble sensing what is going on in
their bodies they lack a nuanced response to frustration they either react to
stress by becoming spaced out or with excessive anger whatever their
response they often can t tell what is upsetting them this failure to be in touch
with their bodies contributes to their well documented lack of self protection and
high rates of revictimization
23
 and also to their remarkable difficulties feeling
pleasure sensuality and having a sense of meaning 
people with alexithymia can get better only by learning to recognize the
relationship between their physical sensations and their emotions much as
colorblind people can only enter the world of color by learning to distinguish
and appreciate shades of gray like my aunt and henry krystal s patients they
usually are reluctant to do that most seem to have made an unconscious
decision that it is better to keep visiting doctors and treating ailments that don t
heal than to do the painful work of facing the demons of the past 

depersonalization
one step further down on the ladder to self oblivion is depersonalization losing
your sense of yourself ute s brain scan in chapter 4 is in its very blankness a
vivid illustration of depersonalization depersonalization is common during
traumatic experiences i was once mugged late at night in a park close to my
home and floating above the scene saw myself lying in the snow with a small
head wound surrounded by three knife wielding teenagers i dissociated the pain
of their stab wounds on my hands and did not feel the slightest fear as i calmly
negotiated for the return of my emptied wallet 
i did not develop ptsd partly i think because i was intensely curious
about having an experience i had studied so closely in others and partly because
i had the delusion that i would be able make a drawing of my muggers to show
to the police of course they were never caught but my fantasy of revenge must
have given me a satisfying sense of agency 
traumatized people are not so fortunate and feel separated from their
bodies one particularly good description of depersonalization comes from the
german psychoanalyst paul schilder writing in berlin in 1928 
24
 to the
depersonalized individual the world appears strange peculiar foreign dream 
like objects appear at times strangely diminished in size at times flat sounds
appear to come from a distance the emotions likewise undergo marked
alteration patients complain that they are capable of experiencing neither pain
nor pleasure they have become strangers to themselves 
i was fascinated to learn that a group of neuroscientists at the university of
geneva
25
 had induced similar out of body experiences by delivering mild
electric current to a specific spot in the brain the temporal parietal junction in
one patient this produced a sensation that she was hanging from the ceiling 
looking down at her body in another it induced an eerie feeling that someone
was standing behind her this research confirms what our patients tell us that
the self can be detached from the body and live a phantom existence on its own 
similarly lanius and frewen as well as a group of researchers at the university
of groningen in the netherlands 
26
 did brain scans on people who dissociated
their terror and found that the fear centers of the brain simply shut down as they
recalled the event 
befriending the body

trauma victims cannot recover until they become familiar with and befriend the
sensations in their bodies being frightened means that you live in a body that is
always on guard angry people live in angry bodies the bodies of child abuse
victims are tense and defensive until they find a way to relax and feel safe in
order to change people need to become aware of their sensations and the way
that their bodies interact with the world around them physical self awareness is
the first step in releasing the tyranny of the past 
how can people open up to and explore their internal world of sensations
and emotions in my practice i begin the process by helping my patients to first
notice and then describe the feelings in their bodies not emotions such as anger
or anxiety or fear but the physical sensations beneath the emotions pressure 
heat muscular tension tingling caving in feeling hollow and so on i also work
on identifying the sensations associated with relaxation or pleasure i help them
become aware of their breath their gestures and movements i ask them to pay
attention to subtle shifts in their bodies such as tightness in their chests or
gnawing in their bellies when they talk about negative events that they claim did
not bother them 
noticing sensations for the first time can be quite distressing and it may
precipitate flashbacks in which people curl up or assume defensive postures 
these are somatic reenactments of the undigested trauma and most likely
represent the postures they assumed when the trauma occurred images and
physical sensations may deluge patients at this point and the therapist must be
familiar with ways to stem torrents of sensation and emotion to prevent them
from becoming retraumatized by accessing the past schoolteachers nurses and
police officers are often very skilled at soothing terror reactions because many of
them are confronted almost daily with out of control or painfully disorganized
people 
all too often however drugs such as abilify zyprexa and seroquel are
prescribed instead of teaching people the skills to deal with such distressing
physical reactions of course medications only blunt sensations and do nothing
to resolve them or transform them from toxic agents into allies 
the most natural way for human beings to calm themselves when they are
upset is by clinging to another person this means that patients who have been
physically or sexually violated face a dilemma they desperately crave touch
while simultaneously being terrified of body contact the mind needs to be
reeducated to feel physical sensations and the body needs to be helped to
tolerate and enjoy the comforts of touch individuals who lack emotional

awareness are able with practice to connect their physical sensations to
psychological events then they can slowly reconnect with themselves 
27
connecting with yourself connecting with
others
i ll end this chapter with one final study that demonstrates the cost of losing your
body after ruth lanius and her group scanned the idling brain they focused on
another question from everyday life what happens in chronically traumatized
people when they make face to face contact 
many patients who come to my office are unable to make eye contact i
immediately know how distressed they are by their difficulty meeting my gaze 
it always turns out that they feel disgusting and that they can t stand having me
see how despicable they are it never occurred to me that these intense feelings
of shame would be reflected in abnormal brain activation ruth lanius once
again showed that mind and brain are indistinguishable what happens in one is
registered in the other 
ruth bought an expensive device that presents a video character to a person
lying in a scanner in this case the cartoon resembled a kindly richard gere 
the figure can approach either head on looking directly at the person or at a
forty five degree angle with an averted gaze this made it possible to compare
the effects of direct eye contact on brain activation with those of an averted
gaze 
28
the most striking difference between normal controls and survivors of
chronic trauma was in activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to a direct
eye gaze the prefrontal cortex pfc normally helps us to assess the person
coming toward us and our mirror neurons help to pick up his intentions 
however the subjects with ptsd did not activate any part of their frontal lobe 
which means they could not muster any curiosity about the stranger they just
reacted with intense activation deep inside their emotional brains in the
primitive areas known as the periaqueductal gray which generates startle 
hypervigilance cowering and other self protective behaviors there was no
activation of any part of the brain involved in social engagement in response to
being looked at they simply went into survival mode 
what does this mean for their ability to make friends and get along with
others what does it mean for their therapy can people with ptsd trust a

therapist with their deepest fears to have genuine relationships you have to be
able to experience others as separate individuals each with his or her particular
motivations and intentions while you need to be able to stand up for yourself 
you also need to recognize that other people have their own agendas trauma can
make all that hazy and gray

and self possessed other 
 diana fosha
he children s clinic at the massachusetts mental health center was filled
with disturbed and disturbing kids they were wild creatures who could not
sit still and who hit and bit other children and sometimes even the staff they
would run up to you and cling to you one moment and run away terrified the
next some masturbated compulsively others lashed out at objects pets and
themselves they were at once starving for affection and angry and defiant the
girls in particular could be painfully compliant whether oppositional or clingy 
none of them seemed able to explore or play in ways typical for children their
age some of them had hardly developed a sense of self they couldn t even
recognize themselves in a mirror 
at the time i knew very little about children apart from what my two
preschoolers were teaching me but i was fortunate in my colleague nina fish 
murray who had studied with jean piaget in geneva in addition to raising five
children of her own piaget based his theories of child development on
meticulous direct observation of children themselves starting with his own
infants and nina brought this spirit to the incipient trauma center at mmhc 
nina was married to the former chairman of the harvard psychology

department henry murray one of the pioneers of personality theory and she
actively encouraged any junior faculty members who shared her interests she
was fascinated by my stories about combat veterans because they reminded her
of the troubled kids she worked with in the boston public schools nina s
privileged position and personal charm gave us access to the children s clinic 
which was run by child psychiatrists who had little interest in trauma 
henry murray had among other things become famous for designing the
widely used thematic apperception test the tat is a so called projective test 
which uses a set of cards to discover how people s inner reality shapes their view
of the world unlike the rorschach cards we used with the veterans the tat
cards depict realistic but ambiguous and somewhat troubling scenes a man and a
woman gloomily staring away from each other a boy looking at a broken violin 
subjects are asked to tell stories about what is going on in the photo what has
happened previously and what happens next in most cases their interpretations
quickly reveal the themes that preoccupy them 
nina and i decided to create a set of test cards specifically for children 
based on pictures we cut out of magazines in the clinic waiting room our first
study compared twelve six to eleven year olds at the children s clinic with a
group of children from a nearby school who matched them as closely as possible
in age race intelligence and family constellation 
1
 what differentiated our
patients was the abuse they had suffered within their families they included a
boy who was severely bruised from repeated beatings by his mother a girl
whose father had molested her at the age of four two boys who had been
repeatedly tied to a chair and whipped and a girl who at the age of five had
seen her mother a prostitute raped dismembered burned and put into the
trunk of a car the mother s pimp was suspected of sexually abusing the girl 
the children in our control group also lived in poverty in a depressed area of
boston where they regularly witnessed shocking violence while the study was
being conducted
 
one boy at their school threw gasoline at a classmate and set
him on fire another boy was caught in crossfire while walking to school with
his father and a friend he was wounded in the groin and his friend was killed 
given their exposure to such a high baseline level of violence would their
responses to the cards differ from those of the hospitalized children 
one of our cards depicted a family scene two smiling kids watching dad
repair a car every child who looked at it commented on the danger to the man
lying underneath the vehicle while the control children told stories with benign
endings the car would get fixed and maybe dad and the kids would drive to

mcdonald s the traumatized kids came up with gruesome tales one girl said
that the little girl in the picture was about to smash in her father s skull with a
hammer a nine year old boy who had been severely physically abused told an
elaborate story about how the boy in the picture kicked away the jack so that the
car mangled his father s body and his blood spurted all over the garage 
as they told us these stories our patients got very excited and disorganized 
we had to take considerable time out at the water cooler and going for walks
before we could show them the next card it was little wonder that almost all of
them had been diagnosed with adhd and most were on ritalin though the
drug certainly didn t seem to dampen their arousal in this situation 
the abused kids gave similar responses to a seemingly innocuous picture of
a pregnant woman silhouetted against a window when we showed it to the
seven year old girl who d been sexually abused at age four she talked about
penises and vaginas and repeatedly asked nina questions like how many
people have you humped like several of the other sexually abused girls in the
study she became so agitated that we had to stop a seven year old girl from the
control group picked up the wistful mood of the picture her story was about a

widowed lady sadly looking out the window missing her husband but in the
end the lady found a loving man to be a good father to her baby 
in card after card we saw that despite their alertness to trouble the children
who had not been abused still trusted in an essentially benign universe they
could imagine ways out of bad situations they seemed to feel protected and safe
within their own families they also felt loved by at least one of their parents 
which seemed to make a substantial difference in their eagerness to engage in
schoolwork and to learn 
the responses of the clinic children were alarming the most innocent
images stirred up intense feelings of danger aggression sexual arousal and

terror we had not selected these photos because they had some hidden meaning
that sensitive people could uncover they were ordinary images of everyday life 
we could only conclude that for abused children the whole world is filled with
triggers as long as they can imagine only disastrous outcomes to relatively
benign situations anybody walking into a room any stranger any image on a
screen or on a billboard might be perceived as a harbinger of catastrophe in this
light the bizarre behavior of the kids at the children s clinic made perfect sense 
2
to my amazement staff discussions on the unit rarely mentioned the horrific
real life experiences of the children and the impact of those traumas on their
feelings thinking and self regulation instead their medical records were filled
with diagnostic labels conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder for
the angry and rebellious kids or bipolar disorder adhd was a comorbid 
diagnosis for almost all was the underlying trauma being obscured by this
blizzard of diagnoses 
now we faced two big challenges one was to learn whether the different
worldview of normal children could account for their resilience and on a deeper
level how each child actually creates her map of the world the other equally
crucial question was is it possible to help the minds and brains of brutalized
children to redraw their inner maps and incorporate a sense of trust and
confidence in the future 
men without mothers
the scientific study of the vital relationship between infants and their mothers
was started by upper class englishmen who were torn from their families as
young boys to be sent off to boarding schools where they were raised in
regimented same sex settings the first time i visited the famed tavistock clinic
in london i noticed a collection of black and white photographs of these great
twentieth century psychiatrists hanging on the wall going up the main staircase 
john bowlby wilfred bion harry guntrip ronald fairbairn and donald
winnicott each of them in his own way had explored how our early
experiences become prototypes for all our later connections with others and how
our most intimate sense of self is created in our minute to minute exchanges
with our caregivers 
scientists study what puzzles them most so that they often become experts
in subjects that others take for granted or as the attachment researcher beatrice

beebe once told me most research is me search these men who studied the
role of mothers in children s lives had themselves been sent off to school at a
vulnerable age sometime between six and ten long before they should have
faced the world alone bowlby himself told me that just such boarding school
experiences probably inspired george orwell s novel 
1984
 which brilliantly
expresses how human beings may be induced to sacrifice everything they hold
dear and true including their sense of self for the sake of being loved and
approved of by someone in a position of authority 
since bowlby was close friends with the murrays i had a chance to talk
with him about his work whenever he visited harvard he was born into an
aristocratic family his father was surgeon to the king s household and he
trained in psychology medicine and psychoanalysis at the temples of the british
establishment after attending cambridge university he worked with delinquent
boys in london s east end a notoriously rough and crime ridden neighborhood
that was largely destroyed during the blitz during and after his service in world
war ii he observed the effects of wartime evacuations and group nurseries that
separated young children from their families he also studied the effect of
hospitalization showing that even brief separations parents back then were not
allowed to visit overnight compounded the children s suffering by the late
1940s bowlby had become 
persona non grata
 in the british psychoanalytic
community as a result of his radical claim that children s disturbed behavior was
a response to actual life experiences to neglect brutality and separation 
rather than the product of infantile sexual fantasies undaunted he devoted the
rest of his life to developing what came to be called attachment theory 
3
a secure base
as we enter this world we scream to announce our presence someone
immediately engages with us bathes us swaddles us and fills our stomachs 
and best of all our mother may put us on her belly or breast for delicious skin 
to skin contact we are profoundly social creatures our lives consist of finding
our place within the community of human beings i love the expression of the
great french psychiatrist pierre janet every life is a piece of art put together
with all means available 
as we grow up we gradually learn to take care of ourselves both physically
and emotionally but we get our first lessons in self care from the way that we

are cared 
for
 mastering the skill of self regulation depends to a large degree on
how harmonious our early interactions with our caregivers are children whose
parents are reliable sources of comfort and strength have a lifetime advantage a
kind of buffer against the worst that fate can hand them 
john bowlby realized that children are captivated by faces and voices and
are exquisitely sensitive to facial expression posture tone of voice 
physiological changes tempo of movement and incipient action he saw this
inborn capacity as a product of evolution essential to the survival of these
helpless creatures children are also programmed to choose one particular adult
 or at most a few with whom their natural communication system develops 
this creates a primary attachment bond the more responsive the adult is to the
child the deeper the attachment and the more likely the child will develop
healthy ways of responding to the people around him 
bowlby would often visit regent s park in london where he would make
systematic observations of the interactions between children and their mothers 
while the mothers sat quietly on park benches knitting or reading the paper the
kids would wander off to explore occasionally looking over their shoulders to
ascertain that mum was still watching but when a neighbor stopped by and
absorbed his mother s interest with the latest gossip the kids would run back and
stay close making sure he still had her attention when infants and young
children notice that their mothers are not fully engaged with them they become
nervous when their mothers disappear from sight they may cry and become
inconsolable but as soon as their mothers return they quiet down and resume
their play 
bowlby saw attachment as the secure base from which a child moves out
into the world over the subsequent five decades research has firmly established
that having a safe haven promotes self reliance and instills a sense of sympathy
and helpfulness to others in distress from the intimate give and take of the
attachment bond children learn that other people have feelings and thoughts that
are both similar to and different from theirs in other words they get in sync 
with their environment and with the people around them and develop the self 
awareness empathy impulse control and self motivation that make it possible
to become contributing members of the larger social culture these qualities
were painfully missing in the kids at our children s clinic 
the dance of attunement

children become attached to whoever functions as their primary caregiver but
the nature of that attachment whether it is secure or insecure makes a huge
difference over the course of a child s life secure attachment develops when
caregiving includes emotional attunement attunement starts at the most subtle
physical levels of interaction between babies and their caretakers and it gives
babies the feeling of being met and understood as edinburgh based attachment
researcher colwyn trevarthen says the brain coordinates rhythmic body
movements and guides them to act in sympathy with other people s brains 
infants hear and learn musicality from their mother s talk even before birth 
4
in chapter 4 i described the discovery of mirror neurons the brain to brain
links that give us our capacity for empathy mirror neurons start functioning as
soon as babies are born when researcher andrew meltzoff at the university of
oregon pursed his lips or stuck out his tongue at six hour old babies they
promptly mirrored his actions 
5
 newborns can focus their eyes only on objects
within eight to twelve inches just enough see the person who is holding them 
imitation is our most fundamental social skill it assures that we automatically
pick up and reflect the behavior of our parents teachers and peers 
most parents relate to their babies so spontaneously that they are barely
aware of how attunement unfolds but an invitation from a friend the attachment
researcher ed tronick gave me the chance to observe that process more closely 
through a one way mirror at harvard s laboratory of human development i
watched a mother playing with her two month old son who was propped in an
infant seat facing her 
they were cooing to each other and having a wonderful time until the
mother leaned in to nuzzle him and the baby in his excitement yanked on her
hair the mother was caught unawares and yelped with pain pushing away his
hand while her face contorted with anger the baby let go immediately and they
pulled back physically from each other for both of them the source of delight
had become a source of distress obviously frightened the baby brought his
hands up to his face to block out the sight of his angry mother the mother in
turn realizing that her baby was upset refocused on him making soothing
sounds in an attempt to smooth things over the infant still had his eyes covered 
but his craving for connection soon reemerged he started peeking out to see if
the coast was clear while his mother reached toward him with a concerned
expression as she started to tickle his belly he dropped his arms and broke into
a happy giggle and harmony was reestablished infant and mother were attuned
again this entire sequence of delight rupture repair and new delight took

slightly less than twelve seconds 
tronick and other researchers have now shown that when infants and
caregivers are in sync on an emotional level they re also in sync physically 
6
babies can t regulate their own emotional states much less the changes in heart
rate hormone levels and nervous system activity that accompany emotions 
when a child is in sync with his caregiver his sense of joy and connection is
reflected in his steady heartbeat and breathing and a low level of stress
hormones
 
 his body is calm so are his emotions the moment this music is
disrupted as it often is in the course of a normal day all these physiological
factors change as well you can tell equilibrium has been restored when the
physiology calms down 
we soothe newborns but parents soon start teaching their children to
tolerate higher levels of arousal a job that is often assigned to fathers i once
heard the psychologist john gottman say mothers stroke and fathers poke 
learning how to manage arousal is a key life skill and parents must do it for
babies before babies can do it for themselves if that gnawing sensation in his
belly makes a baby cry the breast or bottle arrives if he s scared someone holds
and rocks him until he calms down if his bowels erupt someone comes to make
him clean and dry associating intense sensations with safety comfort and
mastery is the foundation of self regulation self soothing and self nurture a
theme to which i return throughout this book 
a secure attachment combined with the cultivation of competency builds an
internal locus of control 
the key factor in healthy coping throughout life 
7
securely attached children learn what makes them feel good they discover what
makes them and others feel bad and they acquire a sense of agency that their
actions can change how they feel and how others respond securely attached
kids learn the difference between situations they can control and situations where
they need help they learn that they can play an active role when faced with
difficult situations in contrast children with histories of abuse and neglect learn
that their terror pleading and crying do not register with their caregiver 
nothing they can do or say stops the beating or brings attention and help in
effect they re being conditioned to give up when they face challenges later in
life 
becoming real

bowlby s contemporary the pediatrician and psychoanalyst donald winnicott is
the father of modern studies of attunement his minute observations of mothers
and children started with the way mothers hold their babies he proposed that
these physical interactions lay the groundwork for a baby s sense of self and 
with that a lifelong sense of identity the way a mother holds her child underlies
 the ability to feel the body as the place where the psyche lives 
8
 this visceral
and kinesthetic sensation of how our bodies are met lays the foundation for what
we experience as real 
9
winnicott thought that the vast majority of mothers did just fine in their
attunement to their infants it does not require extraordinary talent to be what he
called a good enough mother 
10
 but things can go seriously wrong when
mothers are unable to tune in to their baby s physical reality if a mother cannot
meet her baby s impulses and needs the baby learns to become the mother s
idea of what the baby is having to discount its inner sensations and trying to
adjust to its caregiver s needs means the child perceives that something is
wrong with the way it is children who lack physical attunement are vulnerable
to shutting down the direct feedback from their bodies the seat of pleasure 
purpose and direction 
in the years since bowlby s and winnicott s ideas were introduced 
attachment research around the world has shown that the vast majority of
children are securely attached when they grow up their history of reliable 
responsive caregiving will help to keep fear and anxiety at bay barring exposure
to some overwhelming life event trauma that breaks down the self regulatory
system they will maintain a fundamental state of emotional security throughout
their lives secure attachment also forms a template for children s relationships 
they pick up what others are feeling and early on learn to tell a game from
reality and they develop a good nose for phony situations or dangerous people 
securely attached children usually become pleasant playmates and have lots of
self affirming experiences with their peers having learned to be in tune with
other people they tend to notice subtle changes in voices and faces and to adjust
their behavior accordingly they learn to live within a shared understanding of
the world and are likely to become valued members of the community 
this upward spiral can however be reversed by abuse or neglect abused
kids are often very sensitive to changes in voices and faces but they tend to
respond to them as threats rather than as cues for staying in sync dr seth pollak
of the university of wisconsin showed a series of faces to a group of normal
eight year olds and compared their responses with those of a group of abused

children the same age looking at this spectrum of angry to sad expressions the
abused kids were hyperalert to the slightest features of anger 
11
copyright 2000 american psychological association
this is one reason abused children so easily become defensive or scared 
imagine what it s like to make your way through a sea of faces in the school
corridor trying to figure out who might assault you children who overreact to
their peers aggression who don t pick up on other kids needs who easily shut
down or lose control of their impulses are likely to be shunned and left out of
sleepovers or play dates eventually they may learn to cover up their fear by
putting up a tough front or they may spend more and more time alone watching
tv or playing computer games falling even further behind on interpersonal
skills and emotional self regulation 
the need for attachment never lessens most human beings simply cannot
tolerate being disengaged from others for any length of time people who cannot
connect through work friendships or family usually find other ways of bonding 
as through illnesses lawsuits or family feuds anything is preferable to that
godforsaken sense of irrelevance and alienation 
a few years ago on christmas eve i was called to examine a fourteen year 
old boy at the suffolk county jail jack had been arrested for breaking into the
house of neighbors who were away on vacation the burglar alarm was howling
when the police found him in the living room 
the first question i asked jack was who he expected would visit him in jail
on christmas nobody he told me nobody ever pays attention to me it
turned out that he had been caught during breakins numerous times before he
knew the police and they knew him with delight in his voice he told me that
when the cops saw him standing in the middle of the living room they yelled 
 oh my god it s jack again that little motherfucker somebody recognized
him somebody knew his name a little while later jack confessed you know 
that is what makes it worthwhile kids will go to almost any length to feel seen
and connected 

living with the parents you have
children have a biological instinct to attach they have no choice whether their
parents or caregivers are loving and caring or distant insensitive rejecting or
abusive children will develop a coping style based on their attempt to get at
least some of their needs met 
we now have reliable ways to assess and identify these coping styles thanks
largely to the work of two american scientists mary ainsworth and mary main 
and their colleagues who conducted thousands of hours of observation of
mother infant pairs over many years based on these studies ainsworth created
a research tool called the strange situation which looks at how an infant reacts
to temporary separation from the mother just as bowlby had observed securely
attached infants are distressed when their mother leaves them but they show
delight when she returns and after a brief check in for reassurance they settle
down and resume their play 
but with infants who are insecurely attached the picture is more complex 
children whose primary caregiver is unresponsive or rejecting learn to deal with
their anxiety in two distinct ways the researchers noticed that some seemed
chronically upset and demanding with their mothers while others were more
passive and withdrawn in both groups contact with the mothers failed to settle
them down they did not return to play contentedly as happens in secure
attachment 
in one pattern called avoidant attachment the infants look like nothing
really bothers them they don t cry when their mother goes away and they
ignore her when she comes back however this does not mean that they are
unaffected in fact their chronically increased heart rates show that they are in a
constant state of hyperarousal my colleagues and i call this pattern dealing but
not feeling 
12
 most mothers of avoidant infants seem to dislike touching their
children they have trouble snuggling and holding them and they don t use their
facial expressions and voices to create pleasurable back and forth rhythms with
their babies 
in another pattern called anxious or ambivalent attachment the infants
constantly draw attention to themselves by crying yelling clinging or
screaming they are feeling but not dealing 
13
 they seem to have concluded
that unless they make a spectacle nobody is going to pay attention to them they
become enormously upset when they do not know where their mother is but
derive little comfort from her return and even though they don t seem to enjoy

her company they stay passively or angrily focused on her even in situations
when other children would rather play 
14
attachment researchers think that the three organized attachment
strategies secure avoidant and anxious work because they elicit the best care a
particular caregiver is capable of providing infants who encounter a consistent
pattern of care even if it s marked by emotional distance or insensitivity can
adapt to maintain the relationship that does not mean that there are no
problems attachment patterns often persist into adulthood anxious toddlers
tend to grow into anxious adults while avoidant toddlers are likely to become
adults who are out of touch with their own feelings and those of others as in 
 there s nothing wrong with a good spanking i got hit and it made me the
success i am today in school avoidant children are likely to bully other kids 
while the anxious children are often their victims 
15
 however development is
not linear and many life experiences can intervene to change these outcomes 
but there is another group that is less stably adapted a group that makes up
the bulk of the children we treat and a substantial proportion of the adults who
are seen in psychiatric clinics some twenty years ago mary main and her
colleagues at berkeley began to identify a group of children about 15 percent of
those they studied who seemed to be unable to figure out how to engage with
their caregivers the critical issue turned out to be that the caregivers themselves
were a source of distress or terror to the children 
16
children in this situation have no one to turn to and they are faced with an
unsolvable dilemma their mothers are simultaneously necessary for survival and
a source of fear 
17
 they can neither approach the secure and ambivalent
 strategies shift their attention the avoidant strategy nor flee 
18
 if you
observe such children in a nursery school or attachment laboratory you see them
look toward their parents when they enter the room and then quickly turn away 
unable to choose between seeking closeness and avoiding the parent they may
rock on their hands and knees appear to go into a trance freeze with their arms
raised or get up to greet their parent and then fall to the ground not knowing
who is safe or whom they belong to they may be intensely affectionate with
strangers or may trust nobody main called this pattern disorganized
attachment disorganized attachment is fright without solution 
19
becoming disorganized within

conscientious parents often become alarmed when they discover attachment
research worrying that their occasional impatience or their ordinary lapses in
attunement may permanently damage their kids in real life there are bound to be
misunderstandings inept responses and failures of communication because
mothers and fathers miss cues or are simply preoccupied with other matters 
infants are frequently left to their own devices to discover how they can calm
themselves down within limits this is not a problem kids need to learn to
handle frustrations and disappointments with good enough caregivers 
children learn that broken connections can be repaired the critical issue is
whether they can incorporate a feeling of being viscerally safe with their parents
or other caregivers 
20
in a study of attachment patterns in over two thousand infants in normal 
middle class environments 62 percent were found to be secure 15 percent
avoidant 9 percent anxious also known as ambivalent and 15 percent
disorganized 
21
 interestingly this large study showed that the child s gender and
basic temperament have little effect on attachment style for example children
with difficult temperaments are not more likely to develop a disorganized
style kids from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to be
disorganized 
22
 with parents often severely stressed by economic and family
instability 
children who don t feel safe in infancy have trouble regulating their moods
and emotional responses as they grow older by kindergarten many disorganized
infants are either aggressive or spaced out and disengaged and they go on to
develop a range of psychiatric problems 
23
 they also show more physiological
stress as expressed in heart rate heart rate variability 
24
 stress hormone
responses and lowered immune factors 
25
 does this kind of biological
dysregulation automatically reset to normal as a child matures or is moved to a
safe environment so far as we know it does not 
parental abuse is not the only cause of disorganized attachment parents who
are preoccupied with their own trauma such as domestic abuse or rape or the
recent death of a parent or sibling may also be too emotionally unstable and
inconsistent to offer much comfort and protection 
26
 
27
 while all parents need all
the help they can get to help raise secure children traumatized parents in
particular need help to be attuned to their children s needs 
caregivers often don t realize that they are out of tune i vividly remember a
videotape beatrice beebe showed me 
28
 it featured a young mother playing with

her three month old infant everything was going well until the baby pulled back
and turned his head away signaling that he needed a break but the mother did
not pick up on his cue and she intensified her efforts to engage him by bringing
her face closer to his and increasing the volume of her voice when he recoiled
even more she kept bouncing and poking him finally he started to scream at
which point the mother put him down and walked away looking crestfallen she
obviously felt terrible but she had simply missed the relevant cues it s easy to
imagine how this kind of misattunement repeated over and over again can
gradually lead to a chronic disconnection anyone who s raised a colicky or
hyperactive baby knows how quickly stress rises when nothing seems to make a
difference chronically failing to calm her baby down and establish an
enjoyable face to face interaction the mother is likely to come to perceive him
as a difficult child who makes her feel like a failure and give up on trying to
comfort her child 
in practice it often is difficult to distinguish the problems that result from
disorganized attachment from those that result from trauma they are often
intertwined my colleague rachel yehuda studied rates of ptsd in adult new
yorkers who had been assaulted or raped 
29
 those whose mothers were
holocaust survivors with ptsd had a significantly higher rate of developing
serious psychological problems after these traumatic experiences the most
reasonable explanation is that their upbringing had left them with a vulnerable
physiology making it difficult for them to regain their equilibrium after being
violated yehuda found a similar vulnerability in the children of pregnant women
who were in the world trade center that fatal day in 2001 
30
similarly the reactions of children to painful events are largely determined
by how calm or stressed their parents are my former student glenn saxe now
chairman of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at nyu 
showed that when children were hospitalized for treatment of severe burns the
development of ptsd could be predicted by how safe they felt with their
mothers 
31
 the security of their attachment to their mothers predicted the
amount of morphine that was required to control their pain the more secure the
attachment the less painkiller was needed 
another colleague claude chemtob who directs the family trauma
research program at nyu langone medical center studied 112 new york city
children who had directly witnessed the terrorist attacks on 9 11 
32
 children
whose mothers were diagnosed with ptsd or depression during follow up were
six times more likely to have significant emotional problems and eleven times

more likely to be hyperaggressive in response to their experience children
whose fathers had ptsd showed behavioral problems as well but chemtob
discovered that this effect was indirect and was transmitted via the mother 
 living with an irascible withdrawn or terrified spouse is likely to impose a
major psychological burden on the partner including depression 
if you have no internal sense of security it is difficult to distinguish between
safety and danger if you feel chronically numbed out potentially dangerous
situations may make you feel alive if you conclude that you must be a terrible
person because why else would your parents have you treated that way you
start expecting other people to treat you horribly you probably deserve it and
anyway there is nothing you can do about it when disorganized people carry
self perceptions like these they are set up to be traumatized by subsequent
experiences 
33
the long term effects of disorganized
attachment
in the early 1980s my colleague karlen lyons ruth a harvard attachment
researcher began to videotape face to face interactions between mothers and
their infants at six months twelve months and eighteen months she taped them
again when the children were five years old and once more when they were
seven or eight 
34
 all were from high risk families 100 percent met federal
poverty guidelines and almost half the mothers were single parents 
disorganized attachment showed up in two different ways one group of
mothers seemed to be too preoccupied with their own issues to attend to their
infants they were often intrusive and hostile they alternated between rejecting
their infants and acting as if they expected them to respond to 
their
 needs 
another group of mothers seemed helpless and fearful they often came across
as sweet or fragile but they didn t know how to be the adult in the relationship
and seemed to want their children to comfort them
 
they failed to greet their
children after having been away and did not pick them up when the children
were distressed the mothers didn t seem to be doing these things deliberately 
they simply didn t know how to be attuned to their kids and respond to their cues
and thus failed to comfort and reassure them the hostile intrusive mothers were
more likely to have childhood histories of physical abuse and or of witnessing
domestic violence while the withdrawn dependent mothers were more likely to

have histories of sexual abuse or parental loss but not physical abuse 
35
i have always wondered how parents come to abuse their kids after all 
raising healthy offspring is at the very core of our human sense of purpose and
meaning what could drive parents to deliberately hurt or neglect their children 
karlen s research provided me with one answer watching her videos i could
see the children becoming more and more inconsolable sullen or resistant to
their misattuned mothers at the same time the mothers became increasingly
frustrated defeated and helpless in their interactions once the mother comes to
see the child not as her partner in an attuned relationship but as a frustrating 
enraging disconnected stranger the stage is set for subsequent abuse 
about eighteen years later when these kids were around twenty years old 
lyons ruth did a follow up study to see how they were coping infants with
seriously disrupted emotional communication patterns with their mothers at
eighteen months grew up to become young adults with an unstable sense of self 
self damaging impulsivity including excessive spending promiscuous sex 
substance abuse reckless driving and binge eating inappropriate and intense
anger and recurrent suicidal behavior 
karlen and her colleagues had expected that hostile intrusive behavior on
the part of the mothers would be the most powerful predictor of mental
instability in their adult children but they discovered otherwise emotional
withdrawal had the most profound and long lasting impact emotional distance
and role reversal in which mothers expected the kids to look after them were
specifically linked to aggressive behavior against self and others in the young
adults 
dissociation knowing and not knowing
lyons ruth was particularly interested in the phenomenon of dissociation which
is manifested in feeling lost overwhelmed abandoned and disconnected from
the world and in seeing oneself as unloved empty helpless trapped and
weighed down she found a striking and unexpected relationship between
maternal disengagement and misattunement during the first two years of life and
dissociative symptoms in early adulthood lyons ruth concludes that infants
who are not truly seen and known by their mothers are at high risk to grow into
adolescents who are unable to know and to see 
36
infants who live in secure relationships learn to communicate not only their

frustrations and distress but also their emerging selves their interests 
preferences and goals receiving a sympathetic response cushions infants and
adults against extreme levels of frightened arousal but if your caregivers ignore
your needs or resent your very existence you learn to anticipate rejection and
withdrawal you cope as well as you can by blocking out your mother s hostility
or neglect and act as if it doesn t matter but your body is likely to remain in a
state of high alert prepared to ward off blows deprivation or abandonment 
dissociation means simultaneously knowing and not knowing 
37
bowlby wrote what cannot be communicated to the m other cannot be
communicated to the self 
38
 if you cannot tolerate what you know or feel what
you feel the only option is denial and dissociation 
39
 maybe the most
devastating long term effect of this shutdown is not feeling real inside a
condition we saw in the kids in the children s clinic and that we see in the
children and adults who come to the trauma center when you don t feel real
nothing matters which makes it impossible to protect yourself from danger or
you may resort to extremes in an effort to feel 
something
 even cutting yourself
with a razor blade or getting into fistfights with strangers 
karlen s research showed that dissociation is learned early later abuse or
other traumas did not account for dissociative symptoms in young adults 
40
abuse and trauma accounted for many other problems but not for chronic
dissociation or aggression against self the critical underlying issue was that
these patients didn t know how to feel safe lack of safety within the early
caregiving relationship led to an impaired sense of inner reality excessive
clinging and self damaging behavior poverty single parenthood or maternal
psychiatric symptoms did not predict these symptoms 
this does not imply that child abuse is irrelevant
41
 but that the quality of
early caregiving is critically important in preventing mental health problems 
independent of other traumas 
42
 for that reason treatment needs to address not
only the imprints of specific traumatic events but also the consequences of not
having been mirrored attuned to and given consistent care and affection 
dissociation and loss of self regulation 
restoring synchrony
early attachment patterns create the inner maps that chart our relationships
throughout life not only in terms of what we expect from others but also in

terms of how much comfort and pleasure we can experience in their presence i
doubt that the poet e e cummings could have written his joyous lines i like my
body when it is with your body muscles better and nerves more if his
earliest experiences had been frozen faces and hostile glances 
43
 our relationship
maps are implicit etched into the emotional brain and not reversible simply by
understanding how they were created you may realize that your fear of intimacy
has something to do with your mother s postpartum depression or with the fact
that she herself was molested as a child but that alone is unlikely to open you to
happy trusting engagement with others 
however that realization may help you to start exploring other ways to
connect in relationships both for your own sake and in order to not pass on an
insecure attachment to your own children in part 5 i ll discuss a number of
approaches to healing damaged attunement systems through training in
rhythmicity and reciprocity 
44
 being in synch with oneself and with others
requires the integration of our body based senses vision hearing touch and
balance if this did not happen in infancy and early childhood there is an
increased chance of later sensory integration problems to which trauma and
neglect are by no means the only pathways 
being in synch means resonating through sounds and movements that
connect which are embedded in the daily sensory rhythms of cooking and
cleaning going to bed and waking up being in synch may mean sharing funny
faces and hugs expressing delight or disapproval at the right moments tossing
balls back and forth or singing together at the trauma center we have
developed programs to coach parents in connection and attunement and my
patients have told me about many other ways to get themselves in synch ranging
from choral singing and ballroom dancing to joining basketball teams jazz
bands and chamber music groups all of these foster a sense of attunement and
communal pleasure

the night sea journey is the journey into the parts of ourselves that

 stephen cope
arilyn was a tall athletic looking woman in her midthirties who worked as
an operating room nurse in a nearby town she told me that a few months
earlier she d started to play tennis at her sports club with a boston fireman
named michael she usually steered clear of men she said but she had gradually
become comfortable enough with michael to accept his invitations to go out for
pizza after their matches they d talk about tennis movies their nephews and
nieces nothing too personal michael clearly enjoyed her company but she told
herself he didn t really know her 
one saturday evening in august after tennis and pizza she invited him to
stay over at her apartment she described feeling uptight and unreal as soon as
they were alone together she remembered asking him to go slow but had very
little sense of what had happened after that after a few glasses of wine and a
rerun of 
law order
 they apparently fell asleep together on top of her bed at
around two in the morning michael turned over in his sleep when marilyn felt

his body touch hers she exploded pounding him with her fists scratching and
biting screaming you bastard you bastard michael startled awake grabbed
his belongings and fled after he left marilyn sat on her bed for hours stunned
by what had happened she felt deeply humiliated and hated herself for what she
had done and now she d come to me for help in dealing with her terror of men
and her inexplicable rage attacks 
my work with veterans had prepared me to listen to painful stories like
marilyn s without trying to jump in immediately to fix the problem therapy
often starts with some inexplicable behavior attacking a boyfriend in the middle
of the night feeling terrified when somebody looks you in the eye finding
yourself covered with blood after cutting yourself with a piece of glass or
deliberately vomiting up every meal it takes time and patience to allow the
reality behind such symptoms to reveal itself 
terror and numbness
as we talked marilyn told me that michael was the first man she d taken home
in more than five years but this was not the first time she d lost control when a
man spent the night with her she repeated that she always felt uptight and
spaced out when she was alone with a man and there had been other times when
she d come to in her apartment cowering in a corner unable to remember
clearly what had happened 
marilyn also said she felt as if she was just going through the motions of
having a life except for when she was at the club playing tennis or at work in
the operating room she usually felt numb a few years earlier she d found that
she could relieve her numbness by scratching herself with a razor blade but she
had become frightened when she found that she was cutting herself more and
more deeply and more and more often to get relief she had tried alcohol too 
but that reminded her of her dad and his out of control drinking which made her
feel disgusted with herself so instead she played tennis fanatically whenever
she could that made her feel alive 
when i asked her about her past marilyn said she guessed that she must
have had a happy childhood but she could remember very little from before
age twelve she told me she d been a timid adolescent until she had a violent
confrontation with her alcoholic father when she was sixteen and ran away from
home she worked her way through community college and went on to get a
degree in nursing without any help from her parents she felt ashamed that

during this time she d slept around which she described as looking for love in
all the wrong places 
as i often did with new patients i asked her to draw a family portrait and
when i saw her drawing reproduced above i decided to go slowly clearly
marilyn was harboring some terrible memories but she could not allow herself
to recognize what her own picture revealed she had drawn a wild and terrified
child trapped in some kind of cage and threatened not only by three nightmarish
figures one with no eyes but also by a huge erect penis protruding into her
space and yet this woman said she must have had a happy childhood 
as the poet w h auden wrote 
truth like love and sleep resents
approaches that are too intense 
1
i call this auden s rule and in keeping with it i deliberately did not push
marilyn to tell me what she remembered in fact i ve learned that it s not
important for me to know every detail of a patient s trauma what is critical is
that the patients themselves learn to tolerate feeling what they feel and knowing

what they know this may take weeks or even years i decided to start marilyn s
treatment by inviting her to join an established therapy group where she could
find support and acceptance before facing the engine of her distrust shame and
rage 
as i expected marilyn arrived at the first group meeting looking terrified 
much like the girl in her family portrait she was withdrawn and did not reach
out to anybody i d chosen this group for her because its members had always
been helpful and accepting of new members who were too scared to talk they
knew from their own experience that unlocking secrets is a gradual process but
this time they surprised me asking so many intrusive questions about marilyn s
love life that i recalled her drawing of the little girl under assault it was almost
as though marilyn had unwittingly enlisted the group to repeat her traumatic
past i intervened to help her set some boundaries about what she d talk about 
and she began to settle in 
three months later marilyn told the group that she had stumbled and fallen a
few times on the sidewalk between the subway and my office she worried that
her eyesight was beginning to fail she d also been missing a lot of tennis balls
recently i thought again about her drawing and the wild child with the huge 
terrified eyes was this some sort of conversion reaction in which patients
express their conflicts by losing function in some part of their body many
soldiers in both world wars had suffered paralysis that couldn t be traced to
physical injuries and i had seen cases of hysterical blindness in mexico and
india
still as a physician i wasn t about to conclude without further assessment
that this was all in her head i referred her to colleagues at the massachusetts
eye and ear infirmary and asked them to do a very thorough workup several
weeks later the tests came back marilyn had lupus erythematosus of her retina 
an autoimmune disease that was eroding her vision and she would need
immediate treatment i was appalled marilyn was the third person that year
whom i d suspected of having an incest history and who was then diagnosed
with an autoimmune disease a disease in which the body starts attacking itself 
after making sure that marilyn was getting the proper medical care i
consulted with two of my colleagues at massachusetts general psychiatrist
scott wilson and richard kradin who ran the immunology laboratory there i
told them marilyn s story showed them the picture she d drawn and asked them
to collaborate on a study they generously volunteered their time and the
considerable expense of a full immunology workup we recruited twelve women

with incest histories who were not taking any medications plus twelve women
who had never been traumatized and who also did not take meds a surprisingly
difficult control group to find marilyn was not in the study we generally do not
ask our clinical patients to be part of our research efforts 
when the study was completed and the data analyzed rich reported that the
group of incest survivors had abnormalities in their cd45 ra to ro ratio 
compared with their nontraumatized peers cd45 cells are the memory cells of
the immune system some of them called ra cells have been activated by past
exposure to toxins they quickly respond to environmental threats they have
encountered before the ro cells in contrast are kept in reserve for new
challenges they are turned on to deal with threats the body has not met
previously the ra to ro ratio is the balance between cells that recognize
known toxins and cells that wait for new information to activate in patients with
histories of incest the proportion of ra cells that are ready to pounce is larger
than normal this makes the immune system oversensitive to threat so that it is
prone to mount a defense when none is needed even when this means attacking
the body s own cells 
our study showed that on a deep level the bodies of incest victims have
trouble distinguishing between danger and safety this means that the imprint of
past trauma does not consist only of distorted perceptions of information coming
from the outside the organism itself also has a problem knowing how to feel
safe the past is impressed not only on their minds and in misinterpretations of
innocuous events as when marilyn attacked michael because he accidentally
touched her in her sleep but also on the very core of their beings in the safety
of their bodies 
2
a torn map of the world
how do people learn what is safe and what is not safe what is inside and what is
outside what should be resisted and what can safely be taken in the best way
we can understand the impact of child abuse and neglect is to listen to what
people like marilyn can teach us one of the things that became clear as i came
to know her better was that she had her own unique view of how the world
functions 
as children we start off at the center of our own universe where we
interpret everything that happens from an egocentric vantage point if our

parents or grandparents keep telling us we re the cutest most delicious thing in
the world we don t question their judgment we must be exactly that and deep
down no matter what else we learn about ourselves we will carry that sense
with us that we are basically adorable as a result if we later hook up with
somebody who treats us badly we will be outraged it won t feel right it s not
familiar it s not like home but if we are abused or ignored in childhood or
grow up in a family where sexuality is treated with disgust our inner map
contains a different message our sense of our self is marked by contempt and
humiliation and we are more likely to think he or she has my number and
fail to protest if we are mistreated 
marilyn s past shaped her view of every relationship she was convinced
that men didn t give a damn about other people s feelings and that they got away
with whatever they wanted women couldn t be trusted either they were too
weak to stand up for themselves and they d sell their bodies to get men to take
care of them if you were in trouble they wouldn t lift a finger to help you this
worldview manifested itself in the way marilyn approached her colleagues at
work she was suspicious of the motives of anyone who was kind to her and
called them on the slightest deviation from the nursing regulations as for
herself she was a bad seed a fundamentally toxic person who made bad things
happen to those around her 
when i first encountered patients like marilyn i used to challenge their
thinking and try to help them see the world in a more positive flexible way one
day a woman named kathy set me straight a group member had arrived late to a
session because her car had broken down and kathy immediately blamed
herself i saw how rickety your car was last week i knew i should have offered
you a ride her self criticism escalated to the point that only a few minutes
later she was taking responsibility for her sexual abuse i brought it on myself 
i was seven years old and i loved my daddy i wanted him to love me and i did
what he wanted me to do it was my own fault when i intervened to reassure
her saying come on you were just a little girl it was your father s
responsibility to maintain the boundaries kathy turned toward me you know 
bessel she said i know how important it is for you to be a good therapist so
when you make stupid comments like that i usually thank you profusely after
all i am an incest survivor i was trained to take care of the needs of grown up 
insecure men but after two years i trust you enough to tell you that those
comments make me feel terrible yes it s true i instinctively blame myself for
everything bad that happens to the people around me i know that isn t rational 

and i feel really dumb for feeling this way but i do when you try to talk me into
being more reasonable i only feel even more lonely and isolated and it
confirms the feeling that nobody in the whole world will ever understand what it
feels like to be me 
i genuinely thanked her for her feedback and i ve tried ever since not to tell
my patients that they should not feel the way they do kathy taught me that my
responsibility goes much deeper i have to help them reconstruct their inner map
of the world 
as i discussed in the previous chapter attachment researchers have shown
that our earliest caregivers don t only feed us dress us and comfort us when we
are upset they shape the way our rapidly growing brain perceives reality our
interactions with our caregivers convey what is safe and what is dangerous 
whom we can count on and who will let us down what we need to do to get our
needs met this information is embodied in the warp and woof of our brain
circuitry and forms the template of how we think of ourselves and the world
around us these inner maps are remarkably stable across time 
this doesn t mean however that our maps can t be modified by experience 
a deep love relationship particularly during adolescence when the brain once
again goes through a period of exponential change truly can transform us so
can the birth of a child as our babies often teach us how to love adults who
were abused or neglected as children can still learn the beauty of intimacy and
mutual trust or have a deep spiritual experience that opens them to a larger
universe in contrast previously uncontaminated childhood maps can become so
distorted by an adult rape or assault that all roads are rerouted into terror or
despair these responses are not reasonable and therefore cannot be changed
simply by reframing irrational beliefs our maps of the world are encoded in the
emotional brain and changing them means having to reorganize that part of the
central nervous system the subject of the treatment section of this book 
nonetheless learning to recognize irrational thoughts and behavior can be a
useful first step people like marilyn often discover that their assumptions are
not the same as those of their friends if they are lucky their friends and
colleagues will tell them in words rather than in actions that their distrust and
self hatred makes collaboration difficult but that rarely happens and marilyn s
experience was typical after she assaulted michael he had absolutely no
interest in working things out and she lost both his friendship and her favorite
tennis partner it is at this point that smart and courageous people like marilyn 
who maintain their curiosity and determination in the face of repeated defeats 

start looking for help 
generally the rational brain can override the emotional brain as long as our
fears don t hijack us for example your fear at being flagged down by the
police can turn instantly to gratitude when the cop warns you that there s an
accident ahead but the moment we feel trapped enraged or rejected we are
vulnerable to activating old maps and to follow their directions change begins
when we learn to own our emotional brains that means learning to observe
and tolerate the heartbreaking and gut wrenching sensations that register misery
and humiliation only after learning to bear what is going on inside can we start
to befriend rather than obliterate the emotions that keep our maps fixed and
immutable 
learning to remember
about a year into marilyn s group another member mary asked permission to
talk about what had happened to her when she was thirteen years old mary
worked as a prison guard and she was involved in a sadomasochistic
relationship with another woman she wanted the group to know her background
in the hope that they would become more tolerant of her extreme reactions such
as her tendency to shut down or blow up in response to the slightest provocation 
struggling to get the words out mary told us that one evening when she
was thirteen years old she was raped by her older brother and a gang of his
friends the rape resulted in pregnancy and her mother gave her an abortion at
home on the kitchen table the group sensitively tuned in to what mary was
sharing and comforted her through her sobbing i was profoundly moved by their
empathy they were consoling mary in a way that they must have wished
somebody had comforted them when they first confronted their traumas 
when time ran out marilyn asked if she could take a few more minutes to
talk about what she had experienced during the session the group agreed and
she told us hearing that story i wonder if i may have been sexually abused
myself my mouth must have dropped open based on her family drawing i
had always assumed that she was aware at least on some level that this was the
case she had reacted like an incest victim in her response to michael and she
chronically behaved as if the world were a terrifying place 
yet even though she d drawn a girl who was being sexually molested she 
or at least her cognitive verbal self had no idea what had actually happened to
her her immune system her muscles and her fear system all had kept the score 

but her conscious mind lacked a story that could communicate the experience 
she reenacted her trauma in her life but she had no narrative to refer to as we
will see in chapter 12 traumatic memory differs in complex ways from normal
recall and it involves many layers of mind and brain 
triggered by mary s story and spurred on by the nightmares that followed 
marilyn began individual therapy with me in which she started to deal with her
past at first she experienced waves of intense free floating terror she tried
stopping for several weeks but when she found she could no longer sleep and
had to take time off from work she continued our sessions as she told me later 
 my only criterion for whether a situation is harmful is feeling this is going to
kill me if i don t get out 
i began to teach marilyn calming techniques such as focusing on breathing
deeply in and out in and out at six breaths a minute while following the
sensations of the breath in her body this was combined with tapping
acupressure points which helped her not to become overwhelmed we also
worked on mindfulness learning to keep her mind alive while allowing her
body to feel the feelings that she had come to dread slowly enabled marilyn to
stand back and observe her experience rather than being immediately hijacked
by her feelings she had tried to dampen or abolish those feelings with alcohol
and exercise but now she began to feel safe enough to begin to remember what
had happened to her as a girl as she gained ownership over her physical
sensations she also began to be able to tell the difference between past and
present now if she felt someone s leg brush against her in the night she might
be able to recognize it as michael s leg the leg of the handsome tennis partner
she d invited to her apartment that leg did not belong to anyone else and its
touch didn t mean someone was trying to molest her being still enabled her to
know fully physically know that she was a thirty four year old woman and
not a little girl 
when marilyn finally began to access her memories they emerged as
flashbacks of the wallpaper in her childhood bedroom she realized that this was
what she had focused on when her father raped her when she was eight years
old his molestation had scared her beyond her capacity to endure so she had
needed to push it out of her memory bank after all she had to keep living with
this man her father who had assaulted her marilyn remembered having turned
to her mother for protection but when she ran to her and tried to hide herself by
burying her face in her mother s skirt she was met with only a limp embrace at
times her mother remained silent at others she cried or angrily scolded marilyn

for making daddy so angry the terrified child found no one to protect her to
offer strength or shelter 
as roland summit wrote in his classic study 
the child sexual abuse
accommodation syndrome
 initiation intimidation stigmatization isolation 
helplessness and self blame depend on a terrifying reality of child sexual abuse 
any attempts by the child to divulge the secret will be countered by an adult
conspiracy of silence and disbelief don t worry about things like that that
could never happen in our family how could you ever think of such a terrible
thing don t let me ever hear you say anything like that again the average
child never asks and never tells 
3
after forty years of doing this work i still regularly hear myself saying 
 that s unbelievable when patients tell me about their childhoods they often
are as incredulous as i am how could parents inflict such torture and terror on
their own child part of them continues to insist that they must have made the
experience up or that they are exaggerating all of them are ashamed about what
happened to them and they blame themselves on some level they firmly
believe that these terrible things were done to them because they are terrible
people 
marilyn now began to explore how the powerless child had learned to shut
down and comply with whatever was asked of her she had done so by making
herself disappear the moment she heard her father s footsteps in the corridor
outside her bedroom she would put her head in the clouds another patient of
mine who had a similar experience made a drawing that depicts how that process
works when her father started to touch her she made herself disappear she
floated up to the ceiling looking down on some other little girl in the bed 
4
 she
was glad that it was not really her it was some other girl who was being
molested 

looking at these heads separated from their bodies by an impenetrable fog
really opened my eyes to the experience of dissociation which is so common
among incest victims marilyn herself later realized that as an adult she had
continued to float up to the ceiling when she found herself in a sexual situation 
in the period when she d been more sexually active a partner would
occasionally tell her how amazing she d been in bed that he d barely
recognized her that she d even talked differently usually she did not remember
what had happened but at other times she d become angry and aggressive she
had no sense of who she really was sexually so she gradually withdrew from
dating altogether until michael 
hating your home
children have no choice who their parents are nor can they understand that
parents may simply be too depressed enraged or spaced out to be there for them
or that their parents behavior may have little to do with them children have no
choice but to organize themselves to survive within the families they have 
unlike adults they have no other authorities to turn to for help their parents
are
 the authorities they cannot rent an apartment or move in with someone else 
their very survival hinges on their caregivers 

children sense even if it they are not explicitly threatened that if they
talked about their beatings or molestation to teachers they would be punished 
instead they focus their energy on 
not
 thinking about what has happened and not
feeling the residues of terror and panic in their bodies because they cannot
tolerate knowing what they have experienced they also cannot understand that
their anger terror or collapse has anything to do with that experience they
don t talk they act and deal with their feelings by being enraged shut down 
compliant or defiant 
children are also programmed to be fundamentally loyal to their caretakers 
even if they are abused by them terror increases the need for attachment even
if the source of comfort is also the source of terror i have never met a child
below the age of ten who was tortured at home and who had broken bones and
burned skin to show for it who if given the option would not have chosen to
stay with his or her family rather than being placed in a foster home of course 
clinging to one s abuser is not exclusive to childhood hostages have put up bail
for their captors expressed a wish to marry them or had sexual relations with
them victims of domestic violence often cover up for their abusers judges often
tell me how humiliated they feel when they try to protect victims of domestic
violence by issuing restraining orders only to find out that many of them
secretly allow their partners to return 
it took marilyn a long time before she was ready to talk about her abuse 
she was not ready to violate her loyalty to her family deep inside she felt that
she still needed them to protect her against her fears the price of this loyalty is
unbearable feelings of loneliness despair and the inevitable rage of
helplessness rage that has nowhere to go is redirected against the self in the
form of depression self hatred and self destructive actions one of my patients
told me it is like hating your home your kitchen and pots and pans your bed 
your chairs your table your rugs nothing feels safe least of all your own
body 
learning to trust is a major challenge one of my other patients a
schoolteacher whose grandfather raped her repeatedly before she was six sent
me the following e mail i started mulling the danger of opening up with you in
traffic on the way home after our therapy appointment and then as i merged
into route 124 i realized that i had broken the rule of not getting attached to
you and to my students 
during our next meeting she told me she had also been raped by her lab
instructor in college i asked her whether she had sought help and made a

complaint against him i couldn t make myself cross the road to the clinic she
replied i was desperate for help but as i stood there i felt very deeply that i
would only be hurt even more and that might well have been true of course i
had to hide what had happened from my parents and from everyone else 
after i told her that i was concerned about what was going on with her she
wrote me another e mail i m trying to remind myself that i didn t do anything
to deserve such treatment i don t think i have ever had anyone look at me like
that and say they were worried about me and i am holding on to it like a
treasure the idea that i am worth being worried about by someone i respect and
who does understand how deeply i am struggling now 
in order to know who we are to have an identity we must know or at
least feel that we know what is and what was real we must observe what we
see around us and label it correctly we must also be able trust our memories and
be able to tell them apart from our imagination losing the ability to make these
distinctions is one sign of what psychoanalyst william niederland called soul
murder erasing awareness and cultivating denial are often essential to survival 
but the price is that you lose track of who you are of what you are feeling and
of what and whom you can trust

replaying the trauma
one memory of marilyn s childhood trauma came to her in a dream in which she
felt as if she were being choked and was unable to breathe a white tea towel
was wrapped around her hands and then she was lifted up with the towel around
her neck so that she could not touch the ground with her feet she woke in a
panic thinking that she was surely going to die her dream reminded me of the
nightmares war veterans had reported to me seeing the precise unadulterated
images of faces and body parts they had encountered in battle these dreams
were so terrifying that they tried to not fall asleep at night only daytime
napping which was not associated with nocturnal ambushes felt halfway safe 
during this stage of therapy marilyn was repeatedly flooded with images
and sensations related to the choking dream she remembered sitting in the
kitchen as a four year old with swollen eyes a sore neck and a bloody nose 
while her father and brother laughed at her and called her a stupid stupid girl 
one day marilyn reported as i was brushing my teeth last evening i was
overcome with feelings of thrashing around i was like a fish out of water 

violently turning my body as i fought against the lack of air i sobbed and
choked as i brushed my teeth panic was rising up out of my chest with the
feeling of thrashing i had to use every bit of strength i had not to scream 
 nononononono as i stood over the sink she went to bed and fell asleep
but woke up like clockwork every two hours during the rest of the night 
trauma is not stored as a narrative with an orderly beginning middle and
end as i ll discuss in detail in chapters 11 and 12 memories initially return as
they did for marilyn as flashbacks that contain fragments of the experience 
isolated images sounds and body sensations that initially have no context other
than fear and panic when marilyn was a child she had no way of giving voice
to the unspeakable and it would have made no difference anyway nobody was
listening 
like so many survivors of childhood abuse marilyn exemplified the power
of the life force the will to live and to own one s life the energy that counteracts
the annihilation of trauma i gradually came to realize that the only thing that
makes it possible to do the work of healing trauma is awe at the dedication to
survival that enabled my patients to endure their abuse and then to endure the
dark nights of the soul that inevitably occur on the road to recovery

 roland summit 
the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome
ow do we organize our thinking with regard to individuals like marilyn 
mary and kathy and what can we do to help them the way we define
their problems our diagnosis will determine how we approach their care such
patients typically receive five or six different unrelated diagnoses in the course
of their psychiatric treatment if their doctors focus on their mood swings they
will be identified as bipolar and prescribed lithium or valproate if the
professionals are most impressed with their despair they will be told they are
suffering from major depression and given antidepressants if the doctors focus
on their restlessness and lack of attention they may be categorized as adhd
and treated with ritalin or other stimulants and if the clinic staff happens to
take a trauma history and the patient actually volunteers the relevant
information he or she might receive the diagnosis of ptsd none of these
diagnoses will be completely off the mark and none of them will begin to
meaningfully describe who these patients are and what they suffer from 
psychiatry as a subspecialty of medicine aspires to define mental illness as

precisely as let s say cancer of the pancreas or streptococcal infection of the
lungs however given the complexity of mind brain and human attachment
systems we have not come even close to achieving that sort of precision 
understanding what is wrong with people currently is more a question of the
mind set of the practitioner and of what insurance companies will pay for than
of verifiable objective facts 
the first serious attempt to create a systematic manual of psychiatric
diagnoses occurred in 1980 with the release of the third edition of the
diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 
 the official list of all
mental diseases recognized by the american psychiatric association apa the
preamble to the dsm iii warned explicitly that its categories were insufficiently
precise to be used in forensic settings or for insurance purposes nonetheless it
gradually became an instrument of enormous power insurance companies
require a dsm diagnosis for reimbursement until recently all research funding
was based on dsm diagnoses and academic programs are organized around
dsm categories dsm labels quickly found their way into the larger culture as
well millions of people know that tony soprano suffered from panic attacks
and depression and that carrie mathison of 
homeland
 struggles with bipolar
disorder the manual has become a virtual industry that has earned the american
psychiatric association well over 100 million 
1
 the question is has it provided
comparable benefits for the patients it is meant to serve 
a psychiatric diagnosis has serious consequences diagnosis informs
treatment and getting the wrong treatment can have disastrous effects also a
diagnostic label is likely to attach to people for the rest of their lives and have a
profound influence on how they define themselves i have met countless patients
who told me that they are bipolar or borderline or that they have ptsd as if
they had been sentenced to remain in an underground dungeon for the rest of
their lives like the count of monte cristo 
none of these diagnoses takes into account the unusual talents that many of
our patients develop or the creative energies they have mustered to survive all
too often diagnoses are mere tallies of symptoms leaving patients such as
marilyn kathy and mary likely to be viewed as out of control women who
need to be straightened out 
the dictionary defines diagnosis as 
 
a the act or process of identifying or
determining the nature and cause of a disease or injury through evaluation of
patient history examination and review of laboratory data b the opinion
derived from such an evaluation 
2
 in this chapter and the next i will discuss

the chasm between official diagnoses and what our patients actually suffer from
and discuss how my colleagues and i have tried to change the way patients with
chronic trauma histories are diagnosed 
how do you take a trauma history 
in 1985 i started to collaborate with psychiatrist judith herman whose first
book 
father daughter incest
 had recently been published we were both
working at cambridge hospital one of harvard s teaching hospitals and 
sharing an interest in how trauma had affected the lives of our patients we began
to meet regularly and compare notes we were struck by how many of our
patients who were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder bpd told us
horror stories about their childhoods bpd is marked by clinging but highly
unstable relationships extreme mood swings and self destructive behavior 
including self mutilation and repeated suicide attempts in order to uncover
whether there was in fact a relationship between childhood trauma and bpd 
we designed a formal scientific study and sent off a grant proposal to the
national institutes of health it was rejected 
undeterred judy and i decided to finance the study ourselves and we found
an ally in chris perry the director of research at cambridge hospital who was
funded by the national institutes of mental health to study bpd and other near
neighbor diagnoses so called personality disorders in patients recruited from the
cambridge hospital he had collected volumes of valuable data on these
subjects but had never inquired about childhood abuse and neglect even though
he did not hide his skepticism about our proposal he was very generous to us
and arranged for us to interview fifty five patients from the hospital s outpatient
department and he agreed to compare our findings with records in the large
database he had already collected 
the first question judy and i faced was how do you take a trauma history 
you can t ask a patient point blank were you molested as a kid or did your
father beat you up how many would trust a complete stranger with such
delicate information keeping in mind that people universally feel ashamed
about the traumas they have experienced we designed an interview instrument 
the traumatic antecedents questionnaire taq 
3
 the interview started with a
series of simple questions where do you live and who do you live with 
 who pays the bills and who does the cooking and cleaning it progressed

gradually to more revealing questions who do you rely on in your daily life 
as in when you re sick who does the shopping or takes you to the doctor 
 who do you talk to when you are upset in other words who provides you
with emotional and practical support some patients gave us surprising answers 
 my dog or my therapist or nobody 
we then asked similar questions about their childhood who lived in the
household how often did you move who was your primary caretaker many
of the patients reported frequent relocations that required them to change schools
in the middle of the year several had primary caregivers who had gone to jail 
been placed in a mental hospital or joined the military others had moved from
foster home to foster home or had lived with a string of different relatives 
the next section of the questionnaire addressed childhood relationships 
 who in your family was affectionate to you who treated you as a special
person this was followed by a critical question one that to my knowledge 
had never before been asked in a scientific study was there anybody who you
felt safe with growing up one out of four patients we interviewed could not
recall anyone they had felt safe with as a child we checked nobody on our
work sheets and did not comment but we were stunned imagine being a child
and not having a source of safety making your way into the world unprotected
and unseen 
the questions continued who made the rules at home and enforced the
discipline how were kids kept in line by talking scolding spanking 
hitting locking you up how did your parents solve their disagreements by
then the floodgates had usually opened and many patients were volunteering
detailed information about their childhoods one woman had witnessed her little
sister being raped another told us she d had her first sexual experience at age
eight with her grandfather men and women reported lying awake at night
listening to furniture crashing and parents screaming a young man had come
down to the kitchen and found his mother lying in a pool of blood others talked
about not being picked up at elementary school or coming home to find an
empty house and spending the night alone one woman who made her living as a
cook had learned to prepare meals for her family after her mother was jailed on a
drug conviction another had been nine when she grabbed and steadied the car s
steering wheel because her drunken mother was swerving down a four lane
highway during rush hour 
our patients did not have the option to run away or escape they had nobody
to turn to and no place to hide yet they somehow had to manage their terror and

despair they probably went to school the next morning and tried to pretend that
everything was fine judy and i realized that the bpd group s problems 
dissociation desperate clinging to whomever might be enlisted to help had
probably started off as ways of dealing with overwhelming emotions and
inescapable brutality 
after our interviews judy and i met to code our patients answers that is 
to translate them into numbers for computer analysis and chris perry then
collated them with the extensive information on these patients he had stored on
harvard s mainframe computer one saturday morning in april he left us a
message asking us to come to his office there we found a huge stack of
printouts on top of which chris had placed a gary larson cartoon of a group of
scientists studying dolphins and being puzzled by those strange aw blah es
span yol sounds the data had convinced him that unless you understand the
language of trauma and abuse you cannot really understand bpd 
as we later reported in the 
american journal of psychiatry
 81 percent of
the patients diagnosed with bpd at cambridge hospital reported severe histories
of child abuse and or neglect in the vast majority the abuse began before age
seven 
4
 this finding was particularly important because it suggested that the
impact of abuse depends at least in part on the age at which it begins later
research by martin teicher at mclean hospital showed that different forms of
abuse have different impacts on various brain areas at different stages of
development 
5
 although numerous studies have since replicated our findings 
6
 i
still regularly get scientific papers to review that say things like it has been
hypothesized that borderline patients may have histories of childhood trauma 
when does a hypothesis become a scientifically established fact 
our study clearly supported the conclusions of john bowlby 
when children feel pervasively angry or guilty or are chronically
frightened about being abandoned they have come by such feelings
honestly that is because of experience when for example children
fear abandonment it is not in counterreaction to their intrinsic
homicidal urges rather it is more likely because they have been
abandoned physically or psychologically or have been repeatedly
threatened with abandonment when children are pervasively filled
with rage it is due to rejection or harsh treatment when children
experience intense inner conflict regarding their angry feelings this is
likely because expressing them may be forbidden or even dangerous 

bowlby noticed that when children must disown powerful experiences they have
had this creates serious problems including chronic distrust of other people 
inhibition of curiosity distrust of their own senses and the tendency to find
everything unreal 
7
 as we will see this has important implications for
treatment 
our study expanded our thinking beyond the impact of particular
horrendous events the focus of the ptsd diagnosis to look at the long term
effects of brutalization and neglect in caregiving relationships it also raised
another critical question what therapies are effective for people with a history
of abuse particularly those who feel chronically suicidal and deliberately hurt
themselves
 
self harm
during my training i was called from my bed at around 3 00 a m three nights in
a row to stitch up a woman who had slashed her neck with whatever sharp object
she could lay her hands on she told me somewhat triumphantly that cutting
herself made her feel much better ever since then i d asked myself why why
do some people deal with being upset by playing three sets of tennis or drinking
a stiff martini while others carve their arms with razor blades our study
showed that having a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse was a
strong predictor of repeated suicide attempts and self cutting 
8
 i wondered if
their suicidal ruminations had started when they were very young and whether
they had found comfort in plotting their escape by hoping to die or doing
damage to themselves does inflicting harm on oneself begin as a desperate
attempt to gain some sense of control 
chris perry s database had follow up information on all the patients who
were treated in the hospital s outpatient clinics including reports on suicidality
and self destructive behavior after three years of therapy approximately two 
thirds of the patients had markedly improved now the question was which
members of the group had benefited from therapy and which had continued to
feel suicidal and self destructive comparing the patients ongoing behavior
with our taq interviews provided some answers the patients who remained
self destructive had told us that they did not remember feeling safe with anybody
as a child they had reported being abandoned shuttled from place to place and
generally left to their own devices 

i concluded that if you carry a memory of having felt safe with somebody
long ago the traces of that earlier affection can be reactivated in attuned
relationships when you are an adult whether these occur in daily life or in good
therapy however if you lack a deep memory of feeling loved and safe the
receptors in the brain that respond to human kindness may simply fail to
develop 
9
 if that is the case how can people learn to calm themselves down and
feel grounded in their bodies again this has important implications for therapy 
and i ll return to this question throughout part 5 on treatment 
the power of diagnosis
our study also confirmed that there was a traumatized population quite distinct
from the combat soldiers and accident victims for whom the ptsd diagnosis had
been created people like marilyn and kathy as well as the patients judy and i
had studied and the kids in the outpatient clinic at mmhc that i described in
chapter 7 do not necessarily remember their traumas one of the criteria for the
ptsd diagnosis or at least are not preoccupied with specific memories of their
abuse but they continue to behave as if they were still in danger they go from
one extreme to the other they have trouble staying on task and they continually
lash out against themselves and others to some degree their problems do
overlap with those of combat soldiers but they are also very different in that
their childhood trauma has prevented them from developing some of the mental
capacities that adult soldiers possessed before their traumas occurred 
after we realized this a group of us
10
 went to see robert spitzer who after
having guided the development of the 
dsm iii 
 was in the process of revising
the manual he listened carefully to what we told him he told us it was likely
that clinicians who spend their days treating a particular patient population are
likely to develop considerable expertise in understanding what ails them he
suggested that we do a study a so called field trial to compare the problems of
different groups of traumatized individuals 
11
 spitzer put me in charge of the
project first we developed a rating scale that incorporated all the different
trauma symptoms that had been reported in the scientific literature then we
interviewed 525 adult patients at five sites around the country to see if particular
populations suffered from different constellations of problems our populations
fell into three groups those with histories of childhood physical or sexual abuse
by caregivers recent victims of domestic violence and people who had recently

been through a natural disaster 
there were clear differences among these groups particularly those on the
extreme ends of the spectrum victims of child abuse and adults who had
survived natural disasters the adults who had been abused as children often had
trouble concentrating complained of always being on edge and were filled with
self loathing they had enormous trouble negotiating intimate relationships 
often veering from indiscriminate high risk and unsatisfying sexual
involvements to total sexual shutdown they also had large gaps in their
memories often engaged in self destructive behaviors and had a host of medical
problems these symptoms were relatively rare in the survivors of natural
disasters 
each major diagnosis in the dsm had a workgroup responsible for
suggesting revisions for the new edition i presented the results of the field trial
to our 
dsm iv
 ptsd work group and we voted nineteen to two to create a new
trauma diagnosis for victims of interpersonal trauma disorders of extreme
stress not otherwise specified desnos or complex ptsd for short 
12
 
13
we then eagerly anticipated the publication of the 
dsm iv
 in may 1994 but
much to our surprise the diagnosis that our work group had overwhelmingly
approved did not appear in the final product none of us had been consulted 
this was a tragic exclusion it meant that large numbers of patients could
not be accurately diagnosed and that clinicians and researchers would be unable
to scientifically develop appropriate treatments for them you cannot develop a
treatment for a condition that does not exist not having a diagnosis now
confronts therapists with a serious dilemma how do we treat people who are
coping with the fall out of abuse betrayal and abandonment when we are forced
to diagnose them with depression panic disorder bipolar illness or borderline
personality which do not really address what they are coping with 
the consequences of caretaker abuse and neglect are vastly more common
and complex than the impact of hurricanes or motor vehicle accidents yet the
decision makers who determined the shape of our diagnostic system decided not
to recognize this evidence to this day after twenty years and four subsequent
revisions the dsm and the entire system based on it fail victims of child abuse
and neglect just as they ignored the plight of veterans before ptsd was
introduced back in 1980 
the hidden epidemic

how do you turn a newborn baby with all its promise and infinite capacities into
a thirty year old homeless drunk as with so many great discoveries internist
vincent felitti came across the answer to this question accidentally 
in 1985 felitti was chief of kaiser permanente s department of preventive
medicine in san diego which at the time was the largest medical screening
program in the world he was also running an obesity clinic that used a
technique called supplemented absolute fasting to bring about dramatic weight
loss without surgery one day a twenty eight year old nurse s aide showed up in
his office felitti accepted her claim that obesity was her principal problem and
enrolled her in the program over the next fifty one weeks her weight dropped
from 408 pounds to 132 pounds 
however when felitti next saw her a few months later she had regained
more weight than he thought was biologically possible in such a short time 
what had happened it turned out that her newly svelte body had attracted a
male coworker who started to flirt with her and then suggested sex she went
home and began to eat she stuffed herself during the day and ate while
sleepwalking at night when felitti probed this extreme reaction she revealed a
lengthy incest history with her grandfather 
this was only the second case of incest felitti had encountered in his
twenty three year medical practice and yet about ten days later he heard a
similar story as he and his team started to inquire more closely they were
shocked to discover that most of their morbidly obese patients had been sexually
abused as children they also uncovered a host of other family problems 
in 1990 felitti went to atlanta to present data from the team s first 286
patient interviews at a meeting of the north american association for the study
of obesity he was stunned by the harsh response of some experts why did he
believe such patients didn t he realize they would fabricate any explanation for
their failed lives however an epidemiologist from the centers for disease
control and prevention cdc encouraged felitti to start a much larger study 
drawing on a general population and invited him to meet with a small group of
researchers at the cdc the result was the monumental investigation of adverse
childhood experiences now know at the ace study a collaboration between
the cdc and kaiser permanente with robert anda md and vincent felitti 
md as co principal investigators 
more than fifty thousand kaiser patients came through the department of
preventive medicine annually for a comprehensive evaluation filling out an
extensive medical questionnaire in the process felitti and anda spent more than

a year developing ten new questions
14
 covering carefully defined categories of
adverse childhood experiences including physical and sexual abuse physical
and emotional neglect and family dysfunction such as having had parents who
were divorced mentally ill addicted or in prison they then asked 25 000
consecutive patients if they would be willing to provide information about
childhood events 17 421 said yes their responses were then compared with the
detailed medical records that kaiser kept on all patients 
the ace study revealed that traumatic life experiences during childhood
and adolescence are far more common than expected the study respondents
were mostly white middle class middle aged well educated and financially
secure enough to have good medical insurance and yet only one third of the
respondents reported no adverse childhood experiences 
one out of ten individuals responded yes to the question did a
parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at
you insult you or put you down 
more than a quarter responded yes to the questions did one of your
parents often or very often push grab slap or throw something at
you and did one of your parents often or very often hit you so
hard that you had marks or were injured in other words more than
a quarter of the u s population is likely to have been repeatedly
physically abused as a child 
to the questions did an adult or person at least 5 years older ever
have you touch their body in a sexual way and did an adult or
person at least 5 years older ever attempt oral anal or vaginal
intercourse with you 28 percent of women and 16 percent of men
responded affirmatively 
one in eight people responded positively to the questions as a
child did you witness your mother sometimes often or very often
pushed grabbed slapped or had something thrown at her as a
child did you witness your mother sometimes often or very often
kicked bitten hit with a fist or hit with something hard 
15
each yes answer was scored as one point leading to a possible ace score
ranging from zero to ten for example a person who experienced frequent verbal
abuse who had an alcoholic mother and whose parents divorced would have an
ace score of three of the two thirds of respondents who reported an adverse

experience 87 percent scored two or more one in six of all respondents had an
ace score of four or higher 
in short felitti and his team had found that adverse experiences are
interrelated even though they re usually studied separately people typically
don t grow up in a household where one brother is in prison but everything else
is fine they don t live in families where their mother is regularly beaten but life
is otherwise hunky dory incidents of abuse are never stand alone events and
for each additional adverse experience reported the toll in later damage
increases 
felitti and his team found that the effects of childhood trauma first become
evident in school more than half of those with ace scores of four or higher
reported having learning or behavioral problems compared with 3 percent of
those with a score of zero as the children matured they didn t outgrow the
effects of their early experiences as felitti notes traumatic experiences are
often lost in time and concealed by shame secrecy and social taboo but the
study revealed that the impact of trauma pervaded these patients adult lives for
example high ace scores turned out to correlate with higher workplace
absenteeism financial problems and lower lifetime income 
when it came to personal suffering the results were devastating as the
ace score rises chronic depression in adulthood also rises dramatically for
those with an ace score of four or more its prevalence is 66 percent in women
and 35 percent in men compared with an overall rate of 12 percent in those with
an ace score of zero the likelihood of being on antidepressant medication or
prescription painkillers also rose proportionally as felitti has pointed out we
may be treating today experiences that happened fifty years ago at ever 
increasing cost antidepressant drugs and painkillers constitute a significant
portion of our rapidly rising national health care expenditures 
16
 ironically 
research has shown that depressed patients without prior histories of abuse or
neglect tend to respond much better to antidepressants than patients with those
backgrounds 
17
 
self acknowledged suicide attempts rise exponentially with ace scores 
from a score of zero to a score of six there is about a 5 000 percent increased
likelihood of suicide attempts the more isolated and unprotected a person feels 
the more death will feel like the only escape when the media report an
environmental link to a 30 percent increase in the risk of some cancer it is
headline news yet these far more dramatic figures are overlooked 
as part of their initial medical evaluation study participants were asked 

 have you ever considered yourself to be an alcoholic people with an ace
score of four were seven times more likely to be alcoholic than adults with a
score of zero injection drug use increased exponentially for those with an ace
score of six or more the likelihood of iv drug use was 4 600 percent greater
than in those with a score of zero 
women in the study were asked about rape during adulthood at an ace
score of zero the prevalence of rape was 5 percent at a score of four or more it
was 33 percent why are abused or neglected girls so much more likely to be
raped later in life the answers to this question have implications far beyond
rape for example numerous studies have shown that girls who witness
domestic violence while growing up are at much higher risk of ending up in
violent relationships themselves while for boys who witness domestic violence 
the risk that they will abuse their own partners rises sevenfold 
18
 more than 12
percent of study participants had seen their mothers being battered 
the list of high risk behaviors predicted by the ace score included
smoking obesity unintended pregnancies multiple sexual partners and sexually
transmitted diseases finally the toll of major health problems was striking 
those with an ace score of six or above had a 15 percent or greater chance than
those with an ace score of zero of currently suffering from any of the ten
leading causes of death in the united states including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease copd ischemic heart disease and liver disease they were
twice as likely to suffer from cancer and four times as likely to have emphysema 
the ongoing stress on the body keeps taking its toll 
when problems are really solutions
twelve years after he originally treated her felitti again saw the woman whose
dramatic weight loss and gain had started him on his quest she told him that
she d subsequently had bariatric surgery but that after she d lost ninety six
pounds she d become suicidal it had taken five psychiatric hospitalizations and
three courses of electroshock to control her suicidality felitti points out that
obesity which is considered a major public health problem may in fact be a
personal solution for many consider the implications if you mistake someone s
solution for a problem to be eliminated not only are they likely to fail treatment 
as often happens in addiction programs but other problems may emerge 
one female rape victim told felitti overweight is overlooked and that s

the way i need to be

 weight can protect men as well felitti recalls two
guards at a state prison in his obesity program they promptly regained the
weight they had lost because they felt a lot safer being the biggest guy on the
cellblock another male patient became obese after his parents divorced and he
moved in with his violent alcoholic grandfather he explained it wasn t that i
ate because i was hungry and all of that it was just a place for me to feel safe 
all the way from kindergarten i used to get beat up all the time when i got the
weight on it didn t happen anymore 
the ace study group concluded although widely understood to be
harmful to health each adaptation such as smoking drinking drugs obesity is
notably difficult to give up little consideration is given to the possibility that
many long term health risks might also be personally beneficial in the short
term we repeatedly hear from patients of the benefits of these health risks the
idea of the problem being a solution while understandably disturbing to many is
certainly in keeping with the fact that opposing forces routinely coexist in
biological systems what one sees the presenting problem is often only the
marker for the real problem which lies buried in time concealed by patient
shame secrecy and sometimes amnesia and frequently clinician discomfort 
child abuse our nation s largest public health
problem
the first time i heard robert anda present the results of the ace study he could
not hold back his tears in his career at the cdc he had previously worked in
several major risk areas including tobacco research and cardiovascular health 
but when the ace study data started to appear on his computer screen he
realized that they had stumbled upon the gravest and most costly public health
issue in the united states child abuse he had calculated that its overall costs
exceeded those of cancer or heart disease and that eradicating child abuse in
america would reduce the overall rate of depression by more than half 
alcoholism by two thirds and suicide iv drug use and domestic violence by
three quarters 
20
 it would also have a dramatic effect on workplace performance
and vastly decrease the need for incarceration 
when the surgeon general s report on smoking and health was published in
1964 it unleashed a decades long legal and medical campaign that has changed
daily life and long term health prospects for millions the number of american

smokers fell from 42 percent of adults in 1965 to 19 percent in 2010 and it is
estimated that nearly 800 000 deaths from lung cancer were prevented between
1975 and 2000 
21
the ace study however has had no such effect follow up studies and
papers are still appearing around the world but the day to day reality of children
like marilyn and the children in outpatient clinics and residential treatment
centers around the country remains virtually the same only now they receive
high doses of psychotropic agents which makes them more tractable but which
also impairs their ability to feel pleasure and curiosity to grow and develop
emotionally and intellectually and to become contributing members of society

developmental trauma the
hidden epidemic
the notion that early childhood adverse experiences lead to substantial
developmental disruptions is more clinical intuition than a research 
based fact there is no known evidence of developmental disruptions
that were preceded in time in a causal fashion by any type of trauma
syndrome 
 from the american psychiatric association s rejection of a developmental trauma
disorder diagnosis may 2011
research on the effects of early maltreatment tells a different story that
early maltreatment has enduring negative effects on brain development 
our brains are sculpted by our early experiences maltreatment is a
chisel that shapes a brain to contend with strife but at the cost of deep 
enduring wounds childhood abuse isn t something you get over it is
an evil that we must acknowledge and confront if we aim to do
anything about the unchecked cycle of violence in this country 
 martin teicher md phd 
scientific american
here are hundreds of thousands of children like the ones i am about to
describe and they absorb enormous resources often without appreciable
benefit they end up filling our jails our welfare rolls and our medical clinics 
most of the public knows them only as statistics tens of thousands of

schoolteachers probation officers welfare workers judges and mental health
professionals spend their days trying to help them and the taxpayer pays the
bills 
anthony was only two and a half when he was referred to our trauma
center by a childcare center because its employees could not manage his
constant biting and pushing his refusal to take naps and his intractable crying 
head banging and rocking he did not feel safe with any staff member and
fluctuated between despondent collapse and angry defiance 
when we met with him and his mother he anxiously clung to her hiding his
face while she kept saying don t be such a baby he startled when a door
banged somewhere down the corridor and then burrowed deeper into his mom s
lap when she pushed him away he sat in a corner and started to bang his head 
 he just does that to bug me his mother remarked when we asked about her
own background she told us that she d been abandoned by her parents and
raised by a series of relatives who hit her ignored her and started to sexually
abuse her at age thirteen she d become pregnant by a drunken boyfriend who
left her when she told him she was carrying his child anthony was just like his
father she said a good for nothing she had had numerous violent rows with
subsequent boyfriends but she was sure that this had happened too late at night
for anthony to notice 
if anthony were admitted to a hospital he would likely be diagnosed with a
host of different psychiatric disorders depression oppositional defiant disorder 
anxiety reactive attachment disorder adhd and ptsd none of these
diagnoses however would clarify what was wrong with anthony that he was
scared to death and fighting for his life and he did not trust that his mother could
help him 
then there s maria a fifteen year old latina one of the more than half a
million kids in the united states who grow up in foster care and residential
treatment programs maria is obese and aggressive she has a history of sexual 
physical and emotional abuse and has lived in more than twenty out of home
placements since age eight the pile of medical charts that arrived with her
described her as mute vengeful impulsive reckless and self harming with
extreme mood swings and an explosive temper she describes herself as
 garbage worthless rejected 
after multiple suicide attempts maria was placed in one of our residential
treatment centers initially she was mute and withdrawn and became violent
when people got too close to her after other approaches failed to work she was

placed in an equine therapy program where she groomed her horse daily and
learned simple dressage two years later i spoke with maria at her high school
graduation she had been accepted by a four year college when i asked her
what had helped her most she answered the horse i took care of she told me
that she first started to feel safe with her horse he was there every day patiently
waiting for her seemingly glad upon her approach she started to feel a visceral
connection with another creature and began to talk to him like a friend 
gradually she started talking with the other kids in the program and eventually 
with her counselor 
virginia is a thirteen year old adopted white girl she was taken away from
her biological mother because of the mother s drug abuse after her first adoptive
mother fell ill and died she moved from foster home to foster home before being
adopted again virginia was seductive with any male who crossed her path and
she reported sexual and physical abuse by various babysitters and temporary
caregivers she came to our residential treatment program after thirteen crisis
hospitalizations for suicide attempts the staff described her as isolated 
controlling explosive sexualized intrusive vindictive and narcissistic she
described herself as disgusting and said she wished she were dead the
diagnoses in her chart were bipolar disorder intermittent explosive disorder 
reactive attachment disorder attention deficit disorder add hyperactive
subtype oppositional defiant disorder odd and substance use disorder but
who really is virginia how can we help her have a life 
1
we can hope to solve the problems of these children only if we correctly
define what is going on with them and do more than developing new drugs to
control them or trying to find the gene that is responsible for their disease 
the challenge is to find ways to help them lead productive lives and in so doing 
save hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers money that process starts
with facing the facts 
bad genes 
with such pervasive problems and such dysfunctional parents we would be
tempted to ascribe their problems simply to bad genes technology always
produces new directions for research and when it became possible to do genetic
testing psychiatry became committed to finding the genetic causes of mental
illness finding a genetic link seemed particularly relevant for schizophrenia a

fairly common affecting about 1 percent of the population severe and
perplexing form of mental illness and one that clearly runs in families and yet
after thirty years and millions upon millions of dollars worth of research we
have failed to find consistent genetic patterns for schizophrenia or for any
other psychiatric illness for that matter 
2
 some of my colleagues have also
worked hard to discover genetic factors that predispose people to develop
traumatic stress 
3
 that quest continues but so far it has failed to yield any solid
answers 
4
recent research has swept away the simple idea that having a particular
gene produces a particular result it turns out that many genes work together to
influence a single outcome even more important genes are not fixed life events
can trigger biochemical messages that turn them on or off by attaching methyl
groups a cluster of carbon and hydrogen atoms to the outside of the gene a
process called methylation making it more or less sensitive to messages from
the body while life events can change the behavior of the gene they do not alter
its fundamental structure methylation patterns however can be passed on to
offspring a phenomenon known as epigenetics once again the body keeps the
score at the deepest levels of the organism 
one of the most cited experiments in epigenetics was conducted by mcgill
university researcher michael meaney who studies newborn rat pups and their
mothers 
5
 he discovered that how much a mother rat licks and grooms her pups
during the first twelve hours after their birth permanently affects the brain
chemicals that respond to stress and modifies the configuration of over a
thousand genes the rat pups that are intensively licked by their mothers are
braver and produce lower levels of stress hormones under stress than rats whose
mothers are less attentive they also recover more quickly an equanimity that
lasts throughout their lives they develop thicker connections in the
hippocampus a key center for learning and memory and they perform better in
an important rodent skill finding their way through mazes 
we are just beginning to learn that stressful experiences affect gene
expression in humans as well children whose pregnant mothers had been
trapped in unheated houses in a prolonged ice storm in quebec had major
epigenetic changes compared with the children of mothers whose heat had been
restored within a day 
6
 mcgill researcher moshe szyf compared the epigenetic
profiles of hundreds of children born into the extreme ends of social privilege in
the united kingdom and measured the effects of child abuse on both groups 
differences in social class were associated with distinctly different epigenetic

profiles but abused children in both groups had in common specific
modifications in seventy three genes in szyf s words major changes to our
bodies can be made not just by chemicals and toxins but also in the way the
social world talks to the hard wired world

monkeys clarify old questions about nature
versus nurture
one of the clearest ways of understanding how the quality of parenting and
environment affects the expression of genes comes from the work of stephen
suomi chief of the national institutes of health s laboratory of comparative
ethology 
9
 for more than forty years suomi has been studying the transmission
of personality through generations of rhesus monkeys which share 95 percent of
human genes a number exceeded only by chimpanzees and bonobos like
humans rhesus monkeys live in large social groups with complex alliances and
status relationships and only members who can synchronize their behavior with
the demands of the troop survive and flourish 
rhesus monkeys are also like humans in their attachment patterns their
infants depend on intimate physical contact with their mothers and just as
bowlby observed in humans they develop by exploring their reactions to their
environment running back to their mothers whenever they feel scared or lost 
once they become more independent play with their peers is the primary way
they learn to get along in life 
suomi identified two personality types that consistently ran into trouble 
uptight anxious monkeys who become fearful withdrawn and depressed even
in situations where other monkeys will play and explore and highly aggressive
monkeys who make so much trouble that they are often shunned beaten up or
killed both types are biologically different from their peers abnormalities in
arousal levels stress hormones and metabolism of brain chemicals like
serotonin can be detected within the first few weeks of life and neither their
biology nor their behavior tends to change as they mature suomi discovered a
wide range of genetically driven behaviors for example the uptight monkeys
 classified as such on the basis of both their behavior and their high cortisol
levels at six months will consume more alcohol in experimental situations than
the others when they reach the age of four the genetically aggressive monkeys
also overindulge but they binge drink to the point of passing out while the

uptight monkeys seem to drink to calm down 
and yet the social environment also contributes significantly to behavior
and biology the uptight anxious females don t play well with others and thus
often lack social support when they give birth and are at high risk for neglecting
or abusing their firstborns but when these females belong to a stable social
group they often become diligent mothers who carefully watch out for their
young under some conditions being an anxious mom can provide much needed
protection the aggressive mothers on the other hand did not provide any social
advantages very punitive with their offspring there is lots of hitting kicking 
and biting if the infants survive their mothers usually keep them from making
friends with their peers 
in real life it is impossible to tell whether people s aggressive or uptight
behavior is the result of parents genes or of having been raised by an abusive
mother or both but in a monkey lab you can take newborns with vulnerable
genes away from their biological mothers and have them raised by supportive
mothers or in playgroups with peers 
young monkeys who are taken away from their mothers at birth and brought
up solely with their peers become intensely attached to them they desperately
cling to one another and don t peel away enough to engage in healthy
exploration and play what little play there is lacks the complexity and
imagination typical of normal monkeys these monkeys grow up to be uptight 
scared in new situations and lacking in curiosity regardless of their genetic
predisposition peer raised monkeys overreact to minor stresses their cortisol
increases much more in response to loud noises than does that of monkeys who
were raised by their mothers their serotonin metabolism is even more abnormal
than that of the monkeys who are genetically predisposed to aggression but who
were raised by their own mothers this leads to the conclusion that at least in
monkeys early experience has at least as much impact on biology as heredity
does 
monkeys and humans share the same two variants of the serotonin gene
 known as the short and long serotonin transporter alleles in humans the short
allele has been associated with impulsivity aggression sensation seeking 
suicide attempts and severe depression suomi showed that at least in monkeys 
the environment shapes how these genes affect behavior monkeys with the short
allele that were raised by an adequate mother behaved normally and had no
deficit in their serotonin metabolism those who were raised with their peers
became aggressive risk takers 
10
 similarly new zealand researcher alec roy

found that humans with the short allele had higher rates of depression than those
with the long version but that this was true only if they also had a childhood
history of abuse or neglect the conclusion is clear children who are fortunate
enough to have an attuned and attentive parent are not going to develop this
genetically related problem 
11
suomi s work supports everything we ve learned from our colleagues who
study human attachment and from our own clinical research safe and protective
early relationships are critical to protect children from long term problems in
addition even parents with their own genetic vulnerabilities can pass on that
protection to the next generation provided that they are given the right support 
the national child traumatic stress network
nearly every medical disease from cancer to retinitis pigmentosa has advocacy
groups that promote the study and treatment of that particular condition but
until 2001 when the national child traumatic stress network was established
by an act of congress there was no comprehensive organization dedicated to the
research and treatment of traumatized children 
in 1998 i received a call from adam cummings from the nathan cummings
foundation telling me that they were interested in studying the effects of trauma
on learning i told them that while some very good work had been done on that
subject 
12
 there was no forum to implement the discoveries that had already been
made the mental biological or moral development of traumatized children was
not being systematically taught to childcare workers to pediatricians or in
graduate schools of psychology or social work 
adam and i agreed that we had to address this problem some eight months
later we convened a think tank that included representatives from the u s 
department of health and human services and the u s department of justice 
senator ted kennedy s health care adviser and a group of my colleagues who
specialized in childhood trauma we all were familiar with the basics of how
trauma affects the developing mind and brain and we all were aware that
childhood trauma is radically different from traumatic stress in fully formed
adults the group concluded that if we hoped to ever put the issue of childhood
trauma firmly on the map there needed to be a national organization that would
promote both the study of childhood trauma and the education of teachers 
judges ministers foster parents physicians probation officers nurses and

mental health professionals anyone who deals with abused and traumatized
kids 
one member of our work group bill harris had extensive experience with
child related legislation and he went to work with senator kennedy s staff to
craft our ideas into law the bill establishing the national child traumatic stress
network was ushered through the senate with overwhelming bipartisan support 
and since 2001 it has grown from a collaborative network of 17 sites to more
than 150 centers nationwide led by coordinating centers at duke university and
ucla the nctsn includes universities hospitals tribal agencies drug rehab
programs mental health clinics and graduate schools each of the sites in turn 
collaborates with local school systems hospitals welfare agencies homeless
shelters juvenile justice programs and domestic violence shelters with a total of
well over 8 300 affiliated partners 
once the nctsn was up and running we had the means to assemble a
clearer profile of traumatized kids in every part of the country my trauma
center colleague joseph spinazzola led a survey that examined the records of
nearly two thousand children and adolescents from agencies across the
network 
13
 we soon confirmed what we had suspected the vast majority came
from extremely dysfunctional families more than half had been emotionally
abused and or had a caregiver who was too impaired to care for their needs 
almost 50 percent had temporarily lost caregivers to jail treatment programs or
military service and had been looked after by strangers foster parents or distant
relatives about half reported having witnessed domestic violence and a quarter
were also victims of sexual and or physical abuse in other words the children
and adolescents in the survey were mirrors of the middle aged middle class
kaiser permanente patients with high ace scores that vincent felitti had
studied in the adverse childhood experiences ace study 
the power of diagnosis
in the 1970s there was no way to classify the wide ranging symptoms of
hundreds of thousands of returning vietnam veterans as we saw in the opening
chapters of this book this forced clinicians to improvise the treatment of their
patients and prevented them from being able to systematically study what
approaches actually worked the adoption of the ptsd diagnosis by the dsm
iii in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies and to the development of effective

treatments which turned out to be relevant not only to combat veterans but also
to victims of a range of traumatic events including rape assault and motor
vehicle accidents 
14
 an example of the far ranging power of having a specific
diagnosis is the fact that between 2007 and 2010 the department of defense
spent more than 2 7 billion for the treatment of and research on ptsd in
combat veterans while in fiscal year 2009 alone the department of veterans
affairs spent 24 5 million on in house ptsd research 
the dsm definition of ptsd is quite straightforward a person is exposed
to a horrendous event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury 
or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others causing intense fear 
helplessness or horror which results in a variety of manifestations intrusive
reexperiencing of the event flashbacks bad dreams feeling as if the event were
occurring persistent and crippling avoidance of people places thoughts or
feelings associated with the trauma sometimes with amnesia for important parts
of it and increased arousal insomnia hypervigilance or irritability this
description suggests a clear story line a person is suddenly and unexpectedly
devastated by an atrocious event and is never the same again the trauma may
be over but it keeps being replayed in continually recycling memories and in a
reorganized nervous system 
how relevant was this definition to the children we were seeing after a
single traumatic incident a dog bite an accident or witnessing a school
shooting children can indeed develop basic ptsd symptoms similar to those
of adults even if they live in safe and supportive homes as a result of having
the ptsd diagnosis we now can treat those problems quite effectively 
in the case of the troubled children with histories of abuse and neglect who
show up in clinics schools hospitals and police stations the traumatic roots of
their behaviors are less obvious particularly because they rarely talk about
having been hit abandoned or molested even when asked eighty two percent
of the traumatized children seen in the national child traumatic stress network
do not meet diagnostic criteria for ptsd 
15
 because they often are shut down 
suspicious or aggressive they now receive pseudoscientific diagnoses such as
 oppositional defiant disorder meaning this kid hates my guts and won t do
anything i tell him to do or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder meaning
he has temper tantrums having as many problems as they do these kids
accumulate numerous diagnoses over time before they reach their twenties 
many patients have been given four five six or more of these impressive but
meaningless labels if they receive treatment at all they get whatever is being

promulgated as the method of management du jour medications behavioral
modification or exposure therapy these rarely work and often cause more
damage 
as the nctsn treated more and more kids it became increasingly obvious
that we needed a diagnosis that captured the reality of their experience we
began with a database of nearly twenty thousand kids who were being treated in
various sites within the network and collected all the research articles we could
find on abused and neglected kids these were winnowed down to 130
particularly relevant studies that reported on more than one hundred thousand
children and adolescents worldwide a core work group of twelve
clinician researchers specializing in childhood trauma
16
 then convened twice a
year for four years to draft a proposal for an appropriate diagnosis which we
decided to call developmental trauma disorder 
17
as we organized our findings we discovered a consistent profile 1 a
pervasive pattern of dysregulation 2 problems with attention and
concentration and 3 difficulties getting along with themselves and others 
these children s moods and feelings rapidly shifted from one extreme to another
 from temper tantrums and panic to detachment flatness and dissociation 
when they got upset which was much of the time they could neither calm
themselves down nor describe what they were feeling 
having a biological system that keeps pumping out stress hormones to deal
with real or imagined threats leads to physical problems sleep disturbances 
headaches unexplained pain oversensitivity to touch or sound being so
agitated or shut down keeps them from being able to focus their attention and
concentration to relieve their tension they engage in chronic masturbation 
rocking or self harming activities biting cutting burning and hitting
themselves pulling their hair out picking at their skin until it bled it also leads
to difficulties with language processing and fine motor coordination spending
all their energy on staying in control they usually have trouble paying attention
to things like schoolwork that are not directly relevant to survival and their
hyperarousal makes them easily distracted 
having been frequently ignored or abandoned leaves them clinging and
needy even with the people who have abused them having been chronically
beaten molested and otherwise mistreated they can not help but define
themselves as defective and worthless they come by their self loathing sense
of defectiveness and worthlessness honestly was it any surprise that they didn t
trust anyone finally the combination of feeling fundamentally despicable and

overreacting to slight frustrations makes it difficult for them to make friends 
we published the first articles about our findings developed a validated
rating scale 
18
 and collected data on about 350 kids and their parents or foster
parents to establish that this one diagnosis developmental trauma disorder 
captured the full range of what was wrong with these children it would enable
us to give them a single diagnosis as opposed to multiple labels and would
firmly locate the origin of their problems in a combination of trauma and
compromised attachment 
in february 2009 we submitted our proposed new diagnosis of
developmental trauma disorder to the american psychiatric association 
stating the following in a cover letter 
children who develop in the context of ongoing danger maltreatment
and disrupted caregiving systems are being ill served by the current
diagnostic systems that lead to an emphasis on behavioral control with
no recognition of interpersonal trauma studies on the sequelae of
childhood trauma in the context of caregiver abuse or neglect
consistently demonstrate chronic and severe problems with emotion
regulation impulse control attention and cognition dissociation 
interpersonal relationships and self and relational schemas in absence
of a sensitive trauma specific diagnosis such children are currently
diagnosed with an average of 3 8 co morbid disorders the continued
practice of applying multiple distinct co morbid diagnoses to
traumatized children has grave consequences it defies parsimony 
obscures etiological clarity and runs the danger of relegating treatment
and intervention to a small aspect of the child s psychopathology rather
than promoting a comprehensive treatment approach 
shortly after submitting our proposal i gave a talk on developmental
trauma disorder in washington dc to a meeting of the mental health
commissioners from across the country they offered to support our initiative by
writing a letter to the apa the letter began by pointing out that the national
association of state mental health program directors served 6 1 million people
annually with a budget of 29 5 billion and concluded we urge the apa to
add developmental trauma to its list of priority areas to clarify and better
characterize its course and clinical sequelae and to emphasize the strong need to
address developmental trauma in the assessment of patients 

i felt confident that this letter would ensure that the apa would take our
proposal seriously but several months after our submission matthew friedman 
executive director of the national center for ptsd and chair of the relevant
dsm subcommittee informed us that dtd was unlikely to be included in the
dsm 5 the consensus he wrote was that no new diagnosis was required to fill
a missing diagnostic niche one million children who are abused and
neglected every year in the united states a diagnostic niche 
the letter went on the notion that early childhood adverse experiences
lead to substantial developmental disruptions is more clinical intuition than a
research based fact this statement is commonly made but cannot be backed up
by prospective studies in fact we had included several prospective studies in
our proposal let s look at just two of them here 
how relationships shape development
beginning in 1975 and continuing for almost thirty years alan sroufe and his
colleagues tracked 180 children and their families through the minnesota
longitudinal study of risk and adaptation 
19
 at the time the study began there
was an intense debate about the role of nature versus nurture and temperament
versus environment in human development and this study set out to answer
those questions trauma was not yet a popular topic and child abuse and neglect
were not a central focus of this study at least initially until they emerged as the
most important predictors of adult functioning 
working with local medical and social agencies the researchers recruited
first time caucasian mothers who were poor enough to qualify for public
assistance but who had different backgrounds and different kinds and levels of
support available for parenting the study began three months before the
children were born and followed the children for thirty years into adulthood 
assessing and where relevant measuring all the major aspects of their
functioning and all the significant circumstances of their lives it considered
several fundamental questions how do children learn to pay attention while
regulating their arousal i e avoiding extreme highs or lows and keeping their
impulses under control what kinds of supports do they need and when are
these needed 
after extensive interviews and testing of the prospective parents the study
really got off the ground in the newborn nursery where researchers observed the

newborns and interviewed the nurses caring for them they then made home
visits seven and ten days after birth before the children entered first grade they
and their parents were carefully assessed a total of fifteen times after that the
children were interviewed and tested at regular intervals until age twenty eight 
with continuing input from mothers and teachers 
sroufe and his colleagues found that quality of care and biological factors
were closely interwoven it is fascinating to see how the minnesota results echo
 though with far greater complexity what stephen suomi found in his
primate laboratory
 
nothing was written in stone neither the mother s
personality nor the infant s neurological anomalies at birth nor its iq nor its
temperament including its activity level and reactivity to stress predicted
whether a child would develop serious behavioral problems in adolescence 
20
the key issue rather was the nature of the parent child relationship how
parents felt about and interacted with their kids as with suomi s monkeys the
combination of vulnerable infants and inflexible caregivers made for clingy 
uptight kids insensitive pushy and intrusive behavior on the part of the parents
at six months predicted hyperactivity and attention problems in kindergarten and
beyond 
21
focusing on many facets of development particularly relationships with
caregivers teachers and peers sroufe and his colleagues found that caregivers
not only help keep arousal within manageable bounds but also help infants
develop their own ability to regulate their arousal children who were regularly
pushed over the edge into overarousal and disorganization did not develop
proper attunement of their inhibitory and excitatory brain systems and grew up
expecting that they would lose control if something upsetting happened this
was a vulnerable population and by late adolescence half of them had
diagnosable mental health problems there were clear patterns the children
who received consistent caregiving became well regulated kids while erratic
caregiving produced kids who were chronically physiologically aroused the
children of unpredictable parents often clamored for attention and became
intensely frustrated in the face of small challenges their persistent arousal made
them chronically anxious constantly looking for reassurance got in the way of
playing and exploration and as a result they grew up chronically nervous and
nonadventurous 
early parental neglect or harsh treatment led to behavior problems in school
and predicted troubles with peers and a lack of empathy for the distress of
others 
22
 this set up a vicious cycle their chronic arousal coupled with lack of

parental comfort made them disruptive oppositional and aggressive disruptive
and aggressive kids are unpopular and provoke further rejection and punishment 
not only from their caregivers but also from their teachers and peers 
23
sroufe also learned a great deal about resilience the capacity to bounce
back from adversity by far the most important predictor of how well his
subjects coped with life s inevitable disappointments was the level of security
established with their primary caregiver during the first two years of life sroufe
informally told me that he thought that resilience in adulthood could be predicted
by how lovable mothers rated their kids at age two 
24
the long term effects of incest
in 1986 frank putnam and penelope trickett his colleague at the national
institute of mental health initiated the first longitudinal study of the impact of
sexual abuse on female development 
25
 until the results of this study came out 
our knowledge about the effects of incest was based entirely on reports from
children who had recently disclosed their abuse and on accounts from adults
reconstructing years or even decades later how incest had affected them no
study had ever followed girls as they matured to examine how sexual abuse
might influence their school performance peer relationships and self concept 
as well as their later dating life putnam and trickett also looked at changes over
time in their subjects stress hormones reproductive hormones immune
function and other physiological measures in addition they explored potential
protective factors such as intelligence and support from family and peers 
the researchers painstakingly recruited eighty four girls referred by the
district of columbia department of social services who had a confirmed history
of sexual abuse by a family member these were matched with a comparison
group of eighty two girls of the same age race socioeconomic status and
family constellation who had not been abused the average starting age was
eleven over the next twenty years these two groups were thoroughly assessed
six times once a year for the first three years and again at ages eighteen 
nineteen and twenty five their mothers participated in the early assessments 
and their own children took part in the last a remarkable 96 percent of the girls 
now grown women have stayed in the study from its inception 
the results were unambiguous compared with girls of the same age race 
and social circumstances sexually abused girls suffer from a large range of

profoundly negative effects including cognitive deficits depression dissociative
symptoms troubled sexual development high rates of obesity and self 
mutilation they dropped out of high school at a higher rate than the control
group and had more major illnesses and health care utilization they also
showed abnormalities in their stress hormone responses had an earlier onset of
puberty and accumulated a host of different seemingly unrelated psychiatric
diagnoses 
the follow up research revealed many details of how abuse affects
development for example each time they were assessed the girls in both
groups were asked to talk about the worst thing that had happened to them
during the previous year as they told their stories the researchers observed how
upset they became while measuring their physiology during the first
assessment all the girls reacted by becoming distressed three years later in
response to the same question the nonabused girls once again displayed signs of
distress but the abused girls shut down and became numb their biology
matched their observable reactions during the first assessment all of the girls
showed an increase in the stress hormone cortisol three years later cortisol went
down in the abused girls as they reported on the most stressful event of the past
year over time the body adjusts to chronic trauma one of the consequences of
numbing is that teachers friends and others are not likely to notice that a girl is
upset she may not even register it herself by numbing out she no longer reacts
to distress the way she should for example by taking protective action 
putnam s study also captured the pervasive long term effects of incest on
friendships and partnering before the onset of puberty nonabused girls usually
have several girlfriends as well as one boy who functions as a sort of spy who
informs them about what these strange creatures boys are all about after they
enter adolescence their contacts with boys gradually increase in contrast before
puberty the abused girls rarely have close friends girls or boys but adolescence
brings many chaotic and often traumatizing contacts with boys 
lacking friends in elementary school makes a crucial difference today
we re aware how cruel third fourth and fifth grade girls can be it s a complex
and rocky time when friends can suddenly turn on one another and alliances
dissolve in exclusions and betrayals but there is an upside by the time girls get
to middle school most have begun to master a whole set of social skills 
including being able to identify what they feel negotiating relationships with
others pretending to like people they don t and so on and most of them have
built a fairly steady support network of girls who become their stress debriefing

team as they slowly enter the world of sex and dating these relationships give
them room for reflection gossip and discussion of what it all means 
the sexually abused girls have an entirely different developmental pathway 
they don t have friends of either gender because they can t trust they hate
themselves and their biology is against them leading them either to overreact or
numb out they can t keep up in the normal envy driven inclusion exclusion
games in which players have to stay cool under stress other kids usually don t
want anything to do with them they simply are too weird 
but that s only the beginning of the trouble the abused isolated girls with
incest histories mature sexually a year and a half earlier than the nonabused girls 
sexual abuse speeds up their biological clocks and the secretion of sex
hormones early in puberty the abused girls had three to five times the levels of
testosterone and androstenedione the hormones that fuel sexual desire as the
girls in the control group 
results of putnam and trickett s study continue to be published but it has
already created an invaluable road map for clinicians dealing with sexually
abused girls at the trauma center for example one of our clinicians reported
on a monday morning that a patient named ayesha had been raped again 
over the weekend she had run away from her group home at five o clock on
saturday gone to a place in boston where druggies hang out smoked some dope
and done some other drugs and then left with a bunch of boys in a car at five
o clock sunday morning they had gang raped her like so many of the
adolescents we see ayesha can t articulate what she wants or needs and can t
think through how she might protect herself instead she lives in a world of
actions trying to explain her behavior in terms of victim perpetrator isn t
helpful nor are labels like depression oppositional defiant disorder 
 intermittent explosive disorder bipolar disorder or any of the other options
our diagnostic manuals offer us putnam s work has helped us understand how
ayesha experiences the world why she cannot tell us what is going on with her 
why she is so impulsive and lacking in self protection and why she views us as
frightening and intrusive rather than as people who can help her 
the dsm 5 a veritable smorgasbord of
 diagnoses 
when dsm 5 was published in may 2013 it included some three hundred

disorders in its 945 pages it offers a veritable smorgasbord of possible labels for
the problems associated with severe early life trauma including some new ones
such as disruptive mood regulation disorder 
26
 non suicidal self injury 
intermittent explosive disorder dysregulated social engagement disorder and
disruptive impulse control disorder 
27
before the late nineteenth century doctors classified illnesses according to
their surface manifestations like fevers and pustules which was not
unreasonable given that they had little else to go on 
28
 this changed when
scientists like louis pasteur and robert koch discovered that many diseases
were caused by bacteria that were invisible to the naked eye medicine then was
transformed by its attempts to discover ways to get rid of those organisms rather
than just treating the boils and the fevers that they caused with dsm 5
psychiatry firmly regressed to early nineteenth century medical practice despite
the fact that we know the origin of many of the problems it identifies its
 diagnoses describe surface phenomena that completely ignore the underlying
causes 
even before dsm 5 was released the 
american journal of psychiatry
published the results of validity tests of various new diagnoses which indicated
that the dsm largely lacks what in the world of science is known as
 reliability the ability to produce consistent replicable results in other words 
it lacks scientific validity oddly the lack of reliability and validity did not keep
the dsm 5 from meeting its deadline for publication despite the near universal
consensus that it represented no improvement over the previous diagnostic
system 
29
 could the fact that the apa had earned 100 million on the dsm iv
and is slated to take in a similar amount with the dsm 5 because all mental
health practitioners many lawyers and other professionals will be obliged to
purchase the latest edition be the reason we have this new diagnostic system 
diagnostic reliability isn t an abstract issue if doctors can t agree on what
ails their patients there is no way they can provide proper treatment when
there s no relationship between diagnosis and cure a mislabeled patient is bound
to be a mistreated patient you would not want to have your appendix removed
when you are suffering from a kidney stone and you would not want have
somebody labeled as oppositional when in fact his behavior is rooted in an
attempt to protect himself against real danger 
in a statement released in june 2011 the british psychological society
complained to the apa that the sources of psychological suffering in the dsm 5
were identified as located within individuals and overlooked the undeniable

social causation of many such problems 
30
 this was in addition to a flood of
protest from american professionals including leaders of the american
psychological association and the american counseling association why are
relationships or social conditions left out 
31
 if you pay attention only to faulty
biology and defective genes as the cause of mental problems and ignore
abandonment abuse and deprivation you are likely to run into as many dead
ends as previous generations did blaming it all on terrible mothers 
the most stunning rejection of the dsm 5 came from the national institute
of mental health which funds most psychiatric research in america in april
2013 a few weeks before dsm 5 was formally released nimh director
thomas insel announced that his agency could no longer support dsm s
 symptom based diagnosis 
32
 instead the institute would focus its funding on
what are called research domain criteria rdoc 
33
 to create a framework for
studies that would cut across current diagnostic categories for example one of
the nimh domains is arousal modulatory systems arousal circadian
rhythm sleep and wakefulness which are disturbed to varying degrees in
many patients 
like the dsm 5 the rdoc framework conceptualizes mental illnesses
solely as brain disorders this means that future research funding will explore
the brain circuits and other neurobiological measures that underlie mental
problems insel sees this as a first step toward the sort of precision medicine
that has transformed cancer diagnosis and treatment mental illness however is
not at all like cancer humans are social animals and mental problems involve
not being able to get along with other people not fitting in not belonging and in
general not being able to get on the same wavelength 
everything about us our brains our minds and our bodies is geared
toward collaboration in social systems this is our most powerful survival
strategy the key to our success as a species and it is precisely this that breaks
down in most forms of mental suffering as we saw in part 2 the neural
connections in brain and body are vitally important for understanding human
suffering but it is important not to ignore the foundations of our humanity 
relationships and interactions that shape our minds and brains when we are
young and that give substance and meaning to our entire lives 
people with histories of abuse neglect or severe deprivation will remain
mysterious and largely untreated unless we heed the admonition of alan sroufe 
 to fully understand how we become the persons we are the complex step by 
step evolution of our orientations capacities and behavior over time requires

more than a list of ingredients however important any one of them might be it
requires an understanding of the process of development how all of these factors
work together in an ongoing way over time 
34
frontline mental health workers overwhelmed and underpaid social
workers and therapists alike seem to agree with our approach shortly after the
apa rejected developmental trauma disorder for inclusion in the dsm 
thousands of clinicians from around the country sent small contributions to the
trauma center to help us conduct a large scientific study known as a field trial 
to further study dtd that support has enabled us to interview hundreds of kids 
parents foster parents and mental health workers at five different network sites
over the last few years with scientifically constructed interview tools the first
results from these studies have now been published and more will appear as this
book is going to print 
35
what difference would dtd make 
one answer is that it would focus research and treatment not to mention
funding on the central principles that underlie the protean symptoms of
chronically traumatized children and adults pervasive biological and emotional
dysregulation failed or disrupted attachment problems staying focused and on
track and a hugely deficient sense of coherent personal identity and competence 
these issues transcend and include almost all diagnostic categories but
treatment that doesn t put them front and center is more than likely to miss the
mark our great challenge is to apply the lessons of neuroplasticity the
flexibility of brain circuits to rewire the brains and reorganize the minds of
people who have been programmed by life itself to experience others as threats
and themselves as helpless 
social support is a biological necessity not an option and this reality should
be the backbone of all prevention and treatment recognizing the profound
effects of trauma and deprivation on child development need not lead to blaming
parents we can assume that parents do the best they can but all parents need
help to nurture their kids nearly every industrialized nation with the exception
of the united states recognizes this and provides some form of guaranteed
support to families james heckman winner of the 2000 nobel prize in
economics has shown that quality early childhood programs that involve
parents and promote basic skills in disadvantaged children more than pay for

themselves in improved outcomes 
36
in the early 1970s psychologist david olds was working in a baltimore day 
care center where many of the preschoolers came from homes wracked by
poverty domestic violence and drug abuse aware that only addressing the
children s problems at school was not sufficient to improve their home
conditions he started a home visitation program in which skilled nurses helped
mothers to provide a safe and stimulating environment for their children and in
the process to imagine a better future for themselves twenty years later the
children of the home visitation mothers were not only healthier but also less
likely to report having been abused or neglected than a similar group whose
mothers had not been visited they also were more likely to have finished
school to have stayed out of jail and to be working in well paying jobs 
economists have calculated that every dollar invested in high quality home
visitation day care and preschool programs results in seven dollars of savings
on welfare payments health care costs substance abuse treatment and
incarceration plus higher tax revenues due to better paying jobs 
37
when i go to europe to teach i often am contacted by officials at the
ministries of health in the scandinavian countries the united kingdom 
germany or the netherlands and asked to spend an afternoon with them sharing
the latest research on the treatment of traumatized children adolescents and
their families the same is true for many of my colleagues these countries have
already made a commitment to universal health care ensuring a guaranteed
minimum wage paid parental leave for both parents after a child is born and
high quality childcare for all working mothers 
could this approach to public health have something to do with the fact that
the incarceration rate in norway is 71 100 000 in the netherlands 81 100 000 
and the us 781 100 000 while the crime rate in those countries is much lower
than in ours and the cost of medical care about half seventy percent of
prisoners in california spent time in foster care while growing up the united
states spends 84 billion per year to incarcerate people at approximately
 44 000 per prisoner the northern european countries a fraction of that amount 
instead they invest in helping parents to raise their children in safe and
predictable surroundings their academic test scores and crime rates seem to
reflect the success of those investments

uncovering secrets the problem
of traumatic memory
it is a strange thing that all the memories have these two qualities they
are always full of quietness that is the most striking thing about them 
and even when things weren t like that in reality they still seem to have
that quality they are soundless apparitions which speak to me by
looks and gestures wordless and silent and their silence is precisely
what disturbs me 
 erich maria remarque 
all quiet on the western front
n the spring of 2002 i was asked to examine a young man who claimed to
have been sexually abused while he was growing up by paul shanley a
catholic priest who had served in his parish in newton massachusetts now
twenty five years old he had apparently forgotten the abuse until he heard that
the priest was currently under investigation for molesting young boys
 
the
question posed to me was even though he had seemingly repressed the abuse
for well over a decade after it ended were his memories credible and was i
prepared to testify to that fact before a judge 
i will share what this man whom i ll call julian told me drawing on my
original case notes even though his real name is in the public record i m using
a pseudonym because i hope that he has regained some privacy and peace with
the passage of time 
1
 
his experiences illustrate the complexities of traumatic memory the
controversies over the case against father shanley are also typical of the

passions that have swirled around this issue since psychiatrists first described the
unusual nature of traumatic memories in the final decades of the nineteenth
century 
flooded by sensations and images
on february 11 2001 julian was serving as a military policeman at an air force
base during his daily phone conversation with his girlfriend rachel she
mentioned a lead article she d read that morning in the 
boston globe 
 a priest
named shanley was under suspicion for molesting children hadn t julian once
told her about a father shanley who had been his parish priest back in newton 
 did he ever do anything to you she asked julian initially recalled father
shanley as a kind man who d been very supportive after his parents got
divorced but as the conversation went on he started to go into a panic he
suddenly saw shanley silhouetted in a doorframe his hands stretched out at
forty five degrees staring at julian as he urinated overwhelmed by emotion he
told rachel i ve got to go he called his flight chief who came over
accompanied by the first sergeant after he met with the two of them they took
him to the base chaplain julian recalls telling him do you know what is going
on in boston it happened to me too the moment he heard himself say those
words he knew for certain that shanley had molested him even though he did
not remember the details julian felt extremely embarrassed about being so
emotional he had always been a strong kid who kept things to himself 
that night he sat on the corner of his bed hunched over thinking he was
losing his mind and terrified that he would be locked up over the subsequent
week images kept flooding into his mind and he was afraid of breaking down
completely he thought about taking a knife and plunging it into his leg just to
stop the mental pictures then the panic attacks started to be accompanied by
seizures which he called epileptic fits he scratched his body until he bled
 
he
constantly felt hot sweaty and agitated between panic attacks he felt like a
zombie he was observing himself from a distance as if what he was
experiencing were actually happening to somebody else 
in april he received an administrative discharge just ten days short of being
eligible to receive full benefits 
when julian entered my office almost a year later i saw a handsome 
muscular guy who looked depressed and defeated he told me immediately that
he felt terrible about having left the air force he had wanted to make it his

career and he d always received excellent evaluations he loved the challenges
and the teamwork and he missed the structure of the military lifestyle 
julian was born in a boston suburb the second oldest of five children his
father left the family when julian was about six because he could not tolerate
living with julian s emotionally labile mother julian and his father get along
quite well but he sometimes reproaches his father for having worked too hard to
support his family and for abandoning him to the care of his unbalanced mother 
neither his parents nor any of his siblings has ever received psychiatric care or
been involved with drugs 
julian was a popular athlete in high school although he had many friends 
he felt pretty bad about himself and covered up for being a poor student by
drinking and partying he feels ashamed that he took advantage of his popularity
and good looks by having sex with many girls he mentioned wanting to call
several of them to apologize for how badly he d treated them 
he remembered always hating his body in high school he took steroids to
pump himself up and smoked marijuana almost every day he did not go to
college and after graduating from high school he was virtually homeless for
almost a year because he could no longer stand living with his mother he
enlisted to try to get his life back on track 
julian met father shanley at age six when he was taking a ccd catechism 
class at the parish church he remembered father shanley taking him out of the
class for confession father shanley rarely wore a cassock and julian
remembered the priest s dark blue corduroy pants they would go to a big room
with one chair facing another and a bench to kneel on the chairs were covered
with red and there was a red velvet cushion on the bench they played cards a
game of war that turned into strip poker then he remembered standing in front
of a mirror in that room father shanley made him bend over he remembered
father shanley putting a finger into his anus he does not think shanley ever
penetrated him with his penis but he believes that the priest fingered him on
numerous occasions 
other than that his memories were quite incoherent and fragmentary he
had flashes of images of shanley s face and of isolated incidents shanley
standing in the door of the bathroom the priest going down on his knees and
moving it around with his tongue he could not say how old he was when that
happened he remembered the priest telling him how to perform oral sex but he
did not remember actually doing it he remembered passing out pamphlets in
church and then father shanley sitting next to him in a pew fondling him with

one hand and holding julian s hand on himself with the other he remembered
that as he grew older father shanley would pass close to him and caress his
penis paul did not like it but did not know what to do to stop it after all he told
me father shanley was the closest thing to god in my neighborhood 
in addition to these memory fragments traces of his sexual abuse were
clearly being activated and replayed sometimes when he was having sex with
his girlfriend the priest s image popped into his head and as he said he would
 lose it a week before i interviewed him his girlfriend had pushed a finger
into his mouth and playfully said you give good head julian jumped up and
screamed if you ever say that again i ll fucking kill you then terrified they
both started to cry this was followed by one of julian s epileptic fits in which
he curled up in a fetal position shaking and whimpering like a baby while
telling me this julian looked very small and very frightened 
julian alternated between feeling sorry for the old man that father shanley
had become and simply wanting to take him into a room somewhere and kill
him he also spoke repeatedly of how ashamed he felt how hard it was to
admit that he could not protect himself nobody fucks with me and now i have
to tell you this his self image was of a big tough julian 
how do we make sense of a story like julian s years of apparent forgetting 
followed by fragmented disturbing images dramatic physical symptoms and
sudden reenactments as a therapist treating people with a legacy of trauma my
primary concern is not to determine exactly what happened to them but to help
them tolerate the sensations emotions and reactions they experience without
being constantly hijacked by them when the subject of blame arises the central
issue that needs to be addressed is usually self blame accepting that the trauma
was not their fault that it was not caused by some defect in themselves and that
no one could ever have deserved what happened to them 
once a legal case is involved however determination of culpability
becomes primary and with it the admissibility of evidence i had previously
examined twelve people who had been sadistically abused as children in a
catholic orphanage in burlington vermont they had come forward with many
other claimants more than four decades later and although none had had any
contact with the others until the first claim was filed their abuse memories were
astonishingly similar they all named the same names and the particular abuses
that each nun or priest had committed in the same rooms with the same
furniture and as part of the same daily routines most of them subsequently
accepted an out of court settlement from the vermont diocese 

before a case goes to trial the judge holds a so called daubert hearing to set
the standards for expert testimony to be presented to the jury in a 1996 case i
had convinced a federal circuit court judge in boston that it was common for
traumatized people to lose all memories of the event in question only to regain
access to them in bits and pieces at a much later date the same standards would
apply in julian s case while my report to his lawyer remains confidential it was
based on decades of clinical experience and research on traumatic memory 
including the work of some of the great pioneers of modern psychiatry 
normal versus traumatic memory
we all know how fickle memory is our stories change and are constantly revised
and updated when my brothers sisters and i talk about events in our childhood 
we always end up feeling that we grew up in different families so many of our
memories simply do not match such autobiographical memories are not precise
reflections of reality they are stories we tell to convey our personal take on our
experience 
the extraordinary capacity of the human mind to rewrite memory is
illustrated in the grant study of adult development which has systematically
followed the psychological and physical health of more than two hundred
harvard men from their sophomore years of 1939 44 to the present 
2
 of course 
the designers of the study could not have anticipated that most of the participants
would go off to fight in world war ii but we can now track the evolution of
their wartime memories the men were interviewed in detail about their war
experiences in 1945 1946 and again in 1989 1990 four and a half decades later 
the majority gave very different accounts from the narratives recorded in their
immediate postwar interviews with the passage of time events had been
bleached of their intense horror in contrast those who had been traumatized and
subsequently developed ptsd did not modify their accounts their memories
were preserved essentially intact forty five years after the war ended 
whether we remember a particular event at all and how accurate our
memories of it are largely depends on how personally meaningful it was and
how emotional we felt about it at the time the key factor is our level of arousal 
we all have memories associated with particular people songs smells and
places that stay with us for a long time most of us still have precise memories of
where we were and what we saw on tuesday september 11 2001 but only a

fraction of us recall anything in particular about september 10 
most day to day experience passes immediately into oblivion on ordinary
days we don t have much to report when we come home in the evening the
mind works according to schemes or maps and incidents that fall outside the
established pattern are most likely to capture our attention if we get a raise or a
friend tells us some exciting news we will retain the details of the moment at
least for a while we remember insults and injuries best the adrenaline that we
secrete to defend against potential threats helps to engrave those incidents into
our minds even if the content of the remark fades our dislike for the person
who made it usually persists 
when something terrifying happens like seeing a child or a friend get hurt
in an accident we will retain an intense and largely accurate memory of the
event for a long time as james mcgaugh and colleagues have shown the more
adrenaline you secrete the more precise your memory will be 
3
 but that is true
only up to a certain point confronted with horror especially the horror of
 inescapable shock this system becomes overwhelmed and breaks down 
of course we cannot monitor what happens during a traumatic experience 
but we can reactivate the trauma in the laboratory as was done for the brain
scans in chapters 3 and 4 when memory traces of the original sounds images 
and sensations are reactivated the frontal lobe shuts down including as we ve
seen the region necessary to put feelings into words 
4
 the region that creates our
sense of location in time and the thalamus which integrates the raw data of
incoming sensations at this point the emotional brain which is not under
conscious control and cannot communicate in words takes over the emotional
brain the limbic area and the brain stem expresses its altered activation through
changes in emotional arousal body physiology and muscular action under
ordinary conditions these two memory systems rational and emotional 
collaborate to produce an integrated response but high arousal not only changes
the balance between them but also disconnects other brain areas necessary for
the proper storage and integration of incoming information such as the
hippocampus and the thalamus 
5
 as a result the imprints of traumatic
experiences are organized not as coherent logical narratives but in fragmented
sensory and emotional traces images sounds and physical sensations 
6
 julian
saw a man with outstretched arms a pew a staircase a strip poker game he felt
a sensation in his penis a panicked sense of dread but there was little or no
story 

uncovering the secrets of trauma
in the late nineteenth century when medicine first began the systematic study of
mental problems the nature of traumatic memory was one of the central topics
under discussion in france and england a prodigious number of articles were
published on a syndrome known as railway spine a psychological aftermath of
railroad accidents that included loss of memory 
the greatest advances however came in the study of hysteria a mental
disorder characterized by emotional outbursts susceptibility to suggestion and
contractions and paralyses of the muscles that could not be explained by simple
anatomy 
7
 once considered an affliction of unstable or malingering women the
name comes from the greek word for womb hysteria now became a window
into the mysteries of mind and body the names of some of the greatest pioneers
in neurology and psychiatry such as jean martin charcot pierre janet and
sigmund freud are associated with the discovery that trauma is at the root of
hysteria particularly the trauma of childhood sexual abuse 
8
 these early
researchers referred to traumatic memories as pathogenic secrets 
9
 or mental
parasites 
10
 because as much as the sufferers wanted to forget whatever had
happened their memories kept forcing themselves into consciousness trapping
them in an ever renewing present of existential horror 
11
the interest in hysteria was particularly strong in france and as so often
happens its roots lay in the politics of the day jean martin charcot who is
widely regarded as the father of neurology and whose pupils such as gilles de la
tourette lent their names to numerous neurological diseases was also active in
politics after emperor napoleon iii abdicated in 1870 there was a struggle
between the monarchists the old order backed by the clergy and the advocates
of the fledgling french republic who believed in science and in secular
democracy charcot believed that women would be a critical factor in this
struggle and his investigation of hysteria offered a scientific explanation for
phenomena such as demonic possession states witchcraft exorcism and
religious ecstasy 
12
charcot conducted meticulous studies of the physiological and neurological
correlates of hysteria in both men and women all of which emphasized
embodied memory and a lack of language for example in 1889 he published
the case of a patient named lelog who developed paralysis of the legs after
being involved in a traffic accident with a horse drawn cart although lelog fell
to the ground and lost consciousness his legs appeared unhurt and there were

no neurological signs that would indicate a physical cause for his paralysis 
charcot discovered that just before lelog passed out he saw the wheels of the
cart approaching him and strongly believed he would be run over he noted that
 the patient does not preserve any recollection questions addressed to
him upon this point are attended with no result he knows nothing or almost
nothing 
13
 like many other patients at the salp tri re lelog expressed his
experience physically instead of remembering the accident he developed
paralysis of his legs 
14
painting by andre brouillet
jean martin charcot presents the case of a patient with hysteria 
 charcot transformed la
salp tri re an ancient asylum for the poor of paris which he transformed into a modern hospital 
notice the patient s dramatic posture 
but for me the real hero of this story is pierre janet who helped charcot
establish a research laboratory devoted to the study of hysteria at the salp tri re 
in 1889 the same year that the eiffel tower was built janet published the first
book length scientific account of traumatic stress 
l automatisme
psychologique
 
15
 janet proposed that at the root of what we now call ptsd was

the experience of vehement emotions or intense emotional arousal this
treatise explained that after having been traumatized people automatically keep
repeating certain actions emotions and sensations related to the trauma and
unlike charcot who was primarily interested in measuring and documenting
patients physical symptoms janet spent untold hours talking with them trying
to discover what was going on in their minds also in contrast to charcot whose
research focused on understanding the phenomenon of hysteria janet was first
and foremost a clinician whose goal was to treat his patients that is why i
studied his case reports in detail and why he became one of my most important
teachers 
16
amnesia dissociation and reenactment
janet was the first to point out the difference between narrative memory the
stories people tell about trauma and traumatic memory itself one of his case
histories was the story of ir ne a young woman who was hospitalized following
her mother s death from tuberculosis 
17
 ir ne had nursed her mother for many
months while continuing to work outside the home to support her alcoholic
father and pay for her mother s medical care when her mother finally died 
ir ne exhausted from stress and lack of sleep tried for several hours to revive
the corpse calling out to her mother and trying to force medicine down her
throat at one point the lifeless body dropped off the bed while ir ne s drunken
father lay passed out nearby even after an aunt arrived and started preparing for
the burial ir ne s denial persisted she had to be persuaded to attend the funeral 
and she laughed throughout the service a few weeks later she was brought to
the salp tri re where janet took over her case 
in addition to amnesia for her mother s death ir ne suffered from another
symptom several times a week she would stare trancelike at an empty bed 
ignore whatever was going on around her and begin to care for an imaginary
person she meticulously reproduced rather than remembered the details of her
mother s death 
traumatized people simultaneously remember too little and too much on
the one hand ir ne had no conscious memory of her mother s death she could
not tell the story of what had happened on the other she was compelled to
physically act out the events of her mother s death janet s term automatism 
conveys the involuntary unconscious nature of her actions 

janet treated ir ne for several months mainly with hypnosis at the end he
asked her again about her mother s death ir ne started to cry and said don t
remind me of those terrible things my mother was dead and my father was a
complete drunk as always i had to take care of her dead body all night long i
did a lot of silly things in order to revive her in the morning i lost my mind 
not only was ir ne able tell the story but she had also recovered her emotions 
 i feel very sad and abandoned janet now called her memory complete 
because it now was accompanied by the appropriate feelings 
janet noted significant differences between ordinary and traumatic memory 
traumatic memories are precipitated by specific triggers in julian s case the
trigger was his girlfriend s seductive comments in ir ne s it was a bed when
one element of a traumatic experience is triggered other elements are likely to
automatically follow 
traumatic memory is not condensed it took ir ne three to four hours to
reenact her story but when she was finally able to tell what had happened it took
less than a minute the traumatic enactment serves no function in contrast 
ordinary memory is adaptive our stories are flexible and can be modified to fit
the circumstances ordinary memory is essentially social it s a story that we tell
for a purpose in ir ne s case to enlist her doctor s help and comfort in julian s
case to recruit me to join his search for justice and revenge but there is nothing
social about traumatic memory julian s rage at his girlfriend s remark served no
useful purpose reenactments are frozen in time unchanging and they are
always lonely humiliating and alienating experiences 
janet coined the term dissociation to describe the splitting off and
isolation of memory imprints that he saw in his patients he was also prescient
about the heavy cost of keeping these traumatic memories at bay he later wrote
that when patients dissociate their traumatic experience they become attached
to an insurmountable obstacle 
18
 u nable to integrate their traumatic
memories they seem to lose their capacity to assimilate new experiences as well 
it is as if their personality has definitely stopped at a certain point and
cannot enlarge any more by the addition or assimilation of new elements 
19
 he
predicted that unless they became aware of the split off elements and integrated
them into a story that had happened in the past but was now over they would
experience a slow decline in their personal and professional functioning this
phenomenon has now been well documented in contemporary research 
20
janet discovered that while it is normal to change and distort one s
memories people with ptsd are unable to put the actual event the source of

those memories behind them
 
 dissociation prevents the trauma from becoming
integrated within the conglomerated ever shifting stores of autobiographical
memory in essence creating a dual memory system normal memory integrates
the elements of each experience into the continuous flow of self experience by a
complex process of association think of a dense but flexible network where each
element exerts a subtle influence on many others but in julian s case the
sensations thoughts and emotions of the trauma were stored separately as
frozen barely comprehensible fragments if the problem with ptsd is
dissociation
 the goal of treatment would be 
association
 integrating the cut off
elements of the trauma into the ongoing narrative of life so that the brain can
recognize that that was then and this is now 
the origins of the talking cure 
psychoanalysis was born on the wards of the salp tri re in 1885 freud went to
paris to work with charcot and he later named his firstborn son jean martin in
charcot s honor in 1893 freud and his viennese mentor josef breuer cited
both charcot and janet in a brilliant paper on the cause of hysteria 
hysterics
suffer mainly from reminiscences 
 they proclaim and go on to note that these
memories are not subject to the wearing away process of normal memories but
 persist for a long time with astonishing freshness nor can traumatized people
control when they will emerge we must mention another remarkable
fact namely that these memories unlike other memories of their past lives 
are not at the patients disposal on the contrary 
these experiences are
completely absent from the patients memory when they are in a normal
psychical state or are only present in a highly summary form 
 
21
 all italics in
the quoted passages are breuer and freud s 
breuer and freud believed that traumatic memories were lost to ordinary
consciousness either because circumstances made a reaction impossible or
because they started during severely paralyzing affects such as fright in 1896
freud boldly claimed that the ultimate cause of hysteria is always the seduction
of the child by an adult 
22
 then faced with his own evidence of an epidemic of
abuse in the best families of vienna one he noted that would implicate his
own father he quickly began to retreat psychoanalysis shifted to an emphasis
on unconscious wishes and fantasies though freud occasionally kept
acknowledging the reality of sexual abuse 
23
 after the horrors of world war i

confronted him with the reality of combat neuroses freud reaffirmed that lack of
verbal memory is central in trauma and that if a person does not remember he is
likely to act out h e reproduces it not as a memory but as an action he repeats
it without knowing of course that he is repeating and in the end we
understand that this is his way of remembering 
24
the lasting legacy of breuer and freud s 1893 paper is what we now call the
 talking cure 
 
 w e found to our great surprise at first that
 each individual
hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had
succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was
provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect and when the patient had
described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into
words
 all italics in original recollection without affect almost invariably
produces no result 
 
they explain that unless there is an energetic reaction to the traumatic
event the affect remains attached to the memory and cannot be discharged 
the reaction can be discharged by an action from tears to acts of revenge 
 but language serves as a substitute for action by its help an affect can be
 abreacted almost as effectively it will now be understood they conclude 
 how it is that the psychotherapeutic procedure which we have described in
these pages has a curative effect 
it brings to an end the operative force 
which was not abreacted in the first instance
 i e at the time of the trauma 
 by
allowing its strangulated affect to find a way out through speech and it subjects
it to associative correction by introducing it into normal consciousness 
even though psychoanalysis is today in eclipse the talking cure has lived
on and psychologists have generally assumed that telling the trauma story in
great detail will help people to leave it behind that is also a basic premise of
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt which today is taught in graduate
psychology courses around the world 
although the diagnostic labels have changed we continue to see patients
similar to those described by charcot janet and freud in 1986 my colleagues
and i wrote up the case of a woman who had been a cigarette girl at boston s
cocoanut grove nightclub when it burned down in 1942 
25
 during the 1970s and
1980s she annually reenacted her escape on newbury street a few blocks from
the original location which resulted in her being hospitalized with diagnoses like
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in 1989 i reported on a vietnam veteran who
yearly staged an armed robbery on the exact anniversary of a buddy s death 
26
he would put a finger in his pants pocket claim that it was a pistol and tell a

shopkeeper to empty his cash register giving him plenty of time to alert the
police this unconscious attempt to commit suicide by cop came to an end
after a judge referred the veteran to me for treatment once we had dealt with his
guilt about his friend s death there were no further reenactments 
such incidents raise a critical question how can doctors police officers or
social workers recognize that someone is suffering from traumatic stress as long
as he reenacts rather than remember how can patients themselves identify the
source of their behavior if their history is not known they are likely to be
labeled as crazy or punished as criminals rather than helped to integrate the past 
traumatic memory on trial
at least two dozen men had claimed they were molested by paul shanley and
many of them reached civil settlements with the boston archdiocese julian was
the only victim who was called to testify in shanley s trial in february 2005 the
former priest was found guilty on two counts of raping a child and two counts of
assault and battery on a child he was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in
prison 
in 2007 shanley s attorney robert f shaw jr filed a motion for a new
trial challenging shanley s convictions as a miscarriage of justice shaw tried to
make the case that repressed memories were not generally accepted in the
scientific community that the convictions were based on junk science and that
there had been insufficient testimony about the scientific status of repressed
memories before the trial the appeal was rejected by the original trial judge but
two years later was taken up by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts 
almost one hundred leading psychiatrists and psychologists from around the
united states and eight foreign countries signed an amicus curiae brief stating
that repressed memory has never been shown to exist and that it should not
have been admitted as evidence however on january 10 2010 the court
unanimously upheld shanley s conviction with this statement in sum the
judge s finding that the lack of scientific testing did not make unreliable the
theory that an individual may experience dissociative amnesia was supported in
the record there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of expert
testimony on the subject of dissociative amnesia 
in the following chapter i ll talk more about memory and forgetting and
about how the debate over repressed memory which started with freud 
continues to be played out today 

s
chapter 12
the unbearable heaviness of
remembering
our bodies are the texts that carry the memories and therefore
remembering is no less than reincarnation 
 katie cannon
cientific interest in trauma has fluctuated wildly during the past 150 years 
charcot s death in 1893 and freud s shift in emphasis to inner conflicts 
defenses and instincts at the root of mental suffering were just part of
mainstream medicine s overall loss of interest in the subject psychoanalysis
rapidly gained in popularity in 1911 the boston psychiatrist morton prince who
had studied with william james and pierre janet complained that those
interested in the effects of trauma were like clams swamped by the rising tide in
boston harbor 
this neglect lasted for only a few years though because the outbreak of
world war in 1914 once again confronted medicine and psychology with
hundreds of thousands of men with bizarre psychological symptoms 
unexplained medical conditions and memory loss the new technology of
motion pictures made it possible to film these soldiers and today on youtube
we can observe their bizarre physical postures strange verbal utterances 
terrified facial expressions and tics the physical embodied expression of
trauma a memory that is inscribed simultaneously in the mind as interior
images and words and on the body 
1
early in the war the british created the diagnosis of shell shock which

entitled combat veterans to treatment and a disability pension the alternative 
similar diagnosis was neurasthenia for which they received neither treatment
nor a pension it was up to the orientation of the treating physician which
diagnosis a soldier received 
2
more than a million british soldiers served on the western front at any one
time in the first few hours of july 1 1916 alone in the battle of the somme the
british army suffered 57 470 casualties including 19 240 dead the bloodiest day
in its history the historian john keegan says of their commander field marshal
douglas haig whose statue today dominates whitehall in london once the
center of the british empire in his public manner and private diaries no
concern for human suffering was or is discernible at the somme he had sent
the flower of british youth to death or mutilation 
3
as the war wore on shell shock increasingly compromised the efficiency of
the fighting forces caught between taking the suffering of their soldiers
seriously and pursuing victory over the germans the british general staff
issued general routine order number 2384 in june of 1917 which stated in
no circumstances whatever will the expression shell shock be used verbally or
be recorded in any regimental or other casualty report or any hospital or other
medical document all soldiers with psychiatric problems were to be given a
single diagnosis of nydn not yet diagnosed nervous 
4
 in november 1917
the general staff denied charles samuel myers who ran four field hospitals for
wounded soldiers permission to submit a paper on shell shock to the 
british
medical journal
 the germans were even more punitive and treated shell shock
as a character defect which they managed with a variety of painful treatments 
including electroshock 
in 1922 the british government issued the southborough report whose goal
was to prevent the diagnosis of shell shock in any future wars and to undermine
any more claims for compensation it suggested the elimination of shell shock
from all official nomenclature and insisted that these cases should no more be
classified as a battle casualty than sickness or disease is so regarded 
5
 the
official view was that well trained troops properly led would not suffer from
shell shock and that the servicemen who had succumbed to the disorder were
undisciplined and unwilling soldiers while the political storm about the
legitimacy of shell shock continued to rage for several more years reports on
how to best treat these cases disappeared from the scientific literature 
6
in the united states the fate of veterans was also fraught with problems in
1918 when they returned home from the battlefields of france and flanders 

they had been welcomed as national heroes just as the soldiers returning from
iraq and afghanistan are today in 1924 congress voted to award them a bonus
of 1 25 for each day they had served overseas but disbursement was postponed
until 1945 
by 1932 the nation was in the middle of the great depression and in may
of that year about fifteen thousand unemployed and penniless veterans camped
on the mall in washington dc to petition for immediate payment of their
bonuses the senate defeated the bill to move up disbursement by a vote of
sixty two to eighteen a month later president hoover ordered the army to clear
out the veterans encampment army chief of staff general douglas macarthur
commanded the troops supported by six tanks major dwight d eisenhower
was the liaison with the washington police and major george patton was in
charge of the cavalry soldiers with fixed bayonets charged hurling tear gas into
the crowd of veterans the next morning the mall was deserted and the camp
was in flames 
7
 the veterans never received their pensions 
while politics and medicine turned their backs on the returning soldiers the
horrors of the war were memorialized in literature and art in 
all quiet on the
western front

 a novel about the war experiences of frontline soldiers by the
german writer erich maria remarque the book s protagonist paul b umer 
spoke for an entire generation i am aware that i without realizing it have lost
my feelings i don t belong here anymore i live in an alien world i prefer to be
left alone not disturbed by anybody they talk too much i can t relate to them
 they are only busy with superficial things 
9
 published in 1929 the novel
instantly became an international best seller with translations in twenty five
languages the 1930 hollywood film version won the academy award for best
picture 
but when hitler came to power a few years later 
all quiet on the western
front
 was one of the first degenerate books the nazis burned in the public
square in front of humboldt university in berlin 
10
 apparently awareness of the
devastating effects of war on soldiers minds would have constituted a threat to
the nazis plunge into another round of insanity 
denial of the consequences of trauma can wreak havoc with the social fabric
of society the refusal to face the damage caused by the war and the intolerance
of weakness played an important role in the rise of fascism and militarism
around the world in the 1930s the extortionate war reparations of the treaty of
versailles further humiliated an already disgraced germany german society in
turn dealt ruthlessly with its own traumatized war veterans who were treated as

inferior creatures this cascade of humiliations of the powerless set the stage for
the ultimate debasement of human rights under the nazi regime the moral
justification for the strong to vanquish the inferior the rationale for the ensuing
war 
the new face of trauma
the outbreak of world war ii prompted charles samuel myers and the
american psychiatrist abram kardiner to publish the accounts of their work
with world war i soldiers and veterans 
shell shock in france 1914 1918
 1940 
11
 and 
the
 
traumatic neuroses of war
 1941 
12
 served as the principal
guides for psychiatrists who were treating soldiers in the new conflict who had
 war neuroses the u s war effort was prodigious and the advances in
frontline psychiatry reflected that commitment again youtube offers a direct
window on the past hollywood director john huston s documentary 
let there
be light
 1946 shows the predominant treatment for war neuroses at that time 
hypnosis 
13
in huston s film made while he was serving in the army signal corps the
doctors are still patriarchal and the patients are still terrified young men but
they manifest their trauma differently while the world war i soldiers flail have
facial tics and collapse with paralyzed bodies the following generation talks
and cringes their bodies still keep the score their stomachs are upset their
hearts race and they are overwhelmed by panic but the trauma did not just
affect their bodies the trance state induced by hypnosis allowed them to find
words for the things they had been too afraid to remember their terror their
survivor s guilt and their conflicting loyalties it also struck me that these
soldiers seemed to keep a much tighter lid on their anger and hostility than the
younger veterans i d worked with culture shapes the expression of traumatic
stress 
the feminist theorist germaine greer wrote about the treatment of her
father s ptsd after world war ii when the medical officers examined men
exhibiting severe disturbances they almost invariably found the root cause in
pre war experience the sick men were not first grade fighting material the
military proposition is that it is not war which makes men sick but that sick
men can not fight wars 
14
 it seems unlikely the doctors did her father any good 
but greer s efforts to come to grips with his suffering undoubtedly helped fuel

her exploration of sexual domination in all its ugly manifestations of rape incest 
and domestic violence 
when i worked at the va i was puzzled that the vast majority of the
patients we saw on the psychiatry service were young recently discharged
vietnam veterans while the corridors and elevators that led to the medical
departments were filled by old men curious about this disparity i conducted a
survey of the world war ii veterans in the medical clinics in 1983 the vast
majority of them scored positive for ptsd on the rating scales that i
administered but their treatment focused on medical rather than psychiatric
complaints these vets communicated their distress via stomach cramps and
chest pains rather than with nightmares and rage from which my research
showed they also suffered doctors shape how their patients communicate their
distress when a patient complains about terrifying nightmares and his doctor
orders a chest x ray the patient realizes that he ll get better care if he focuses on
his physical problems like my relatives who fought in or were captured during
world war ii most of these men were extremely reluctant to share their
experiences my sense was that neither the doctors nor their patients wanted to
revisit the war 
however military and civilian leaders came away from world war ii with
important lessons that the previous generation had failed to grasp after the
defeat of nazi germany and imperial japan the united states helped rebuild
europe by means of the marshall plan which formed the economic foundation
of the next fifty years of relative peace at home the gi bill provided millions
of veterans with educations and home mortgages which promoted general
economic well being and created a broad based well educated middle class the
armed forces led the nation in racial integration and opportunity the veterans
administration built facilities nationwide to help combat veterans with their
health care still with all this thoughtful attention to the returning veterans the
psychological scars of war went unrecognized and traumatic neuroses
disappeared entirely from official psychiatric nomenclature the last scientific
writing on combat trauma after world war ii appeared in 1947 
15
trauma rediscovered
as i noted earlier when i started to work with vietnam veterans there was not a
single book on war trauma in the library of the va but the vietnam war inspired

numerous studies the formation of scholarly organizations and the inclusion of
a trauma diagnosis ptsd in the professional literature at the same time 
interest in trauma was exploding in the general public 
in 1974 freedman and kaplan s 
comprehensive textbook of psychiatry
stated that incest is extremely rare and does not occur in more than 1 out of 1 1
million people 
16
 as we have seen in chapter 2 this authoritative textbook then
went on to extol the possible benefits of incest such incestuous activity
diminishes the subject s chance of psychosis and allows for a better adjustment
to the external world the vast majority of them were none the worse for the
experience 
how misguided those statements were became obvious when the ascendant
feminist movement combined with awareness of trauma in returning combat
veterans emboldened tens of thousands of survivors of childhood sexual abuse 
domestic abuse and rape to come forward consciousness raising groups and
survivor groups were formed and numerous popular books including 
the
courage to heal
 1988 a best selling self help book for survivors of incest and
judith herman s book 
trauma and recovery 
 1992 discussed the stages of
treatment and recovery in great detail 
cautioned by history i began to wonder if we were headed toward another
backlash like those of 1895 1917 and 1947 against acknowledging the reality of
trauma that proved to be the case for by the early 1990s articles had started to
appear in many leading newspapers and magazines in united states and in
europe about a so called false memory syndrome in which psychiatric patients
supposedly manufactured elaborate false memories of sexual abuse which they
then claimed had lain dormant for many years before being recovered 
what was striking about these articles was the certainty with which they
stated that there was no evidence that people remember trauma any differently
than they do ordinary events i vividly recall a phone call from a well known
newsweekly in london telling me that they planned to publish an article about
traumatic memory in their next issue and asking me whether i had any
comments on the subject i was quite enthusiastic about their question and told
them that memory loss for traumatic events had first been studied in england
well over a century earlier i mentioned john eric erichsen and frederic myers s
work on railway accidents in the 1860s and 1870s and charles samuel myers s
and w h r rivers s extensive studies of memory problems in combat soldiers
of world war i i also suggested they look at an article published in 
the lancet
in 1944 which described the aftermath of the rescue of the entire british army

from the beaches of dunkirk in 1940 more than 10 percent of the soldiers who
were studied had suffered from major memory loss after the evacuation 
17
 the
following week the magazine told its readers that there was no evidence
whatsoever that people sometimes lose some or all memory for traumatic events 
the issue of delayed recall of trauma was not particularly controversial
when myers and kardiner first described this phenomenon in their books on
combat neuroses in world war i when major memory loss was observed after
the evacuation from dunkirk or when i wrote about vietnam veterans and the
survivor of the cocoanut grove nightclub fire however during the 1980s and
early 1990s as similar memory problems began to be documented in women and
children in the context of domestic abuse the efforts of abuse victims to seek
justice against their alleged perpetrators moved the issue from science into
politics and law this in turn became the context for the pedophile scandals in
the catholic church in which memory experts were pitted against one another
in courtrooms across the united states and later in europe and australia 
experts testifying on behalf of the church claimed that memories of
childhood sexual abuse were unreliable at best and that the claims being made
by alleged victims more likely resulted from false memories implanted in their
minds by therapists who were oversympathetic credulous or driven by their
own agendas during this period i examined more than fifty adults who like
julian remembered having been abused by priests their claims were denied in
about half the cases 
the science of repressed memory
there have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well over a
century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed only to
resurface years or decades later 
18
 memory loss has been reported in people who
have experienced natural disasters accidents war trauma kidnapping torture 
concentration camps and physical and sexual abuse total memory loss is most
common in childhood sexual abuse with incidence ranging from 19 percent to
38 percent 
19
 this issue is not particularly controversial as early as 1980 the
dsm iii recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the
diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia an inability to recall important
personal information usually of a traumatic or stressful nature that is too
extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness memory loss has been part

of the criteria for ptsd since that diagnosis was first introduced 
one of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by
dr linda meyer williams which began when she was a graduate student in
sociology at the university of pennsylvania in the early 1970s williams
interviewed 206 girls between the ages of ten and twelve who had been admitted
to a hospital emergency room following sexual abuse their laboratory tests as
well as the interviews with the children and their parents were kept in the
hospital s medical records seventeen years later williams was able to track
down 136 of the children now adults with whom she conducted extensive
follow up interviews 
20
 more than a third of the women 38 percent did not
recall the abuse that was documented in their medical records while only fifteen
women 12 percent said that they had never been abused as children more than
two thirds 68 percent reported other incidents of childhood sexual abuse 
women who were younger at the time of the incident and those who were
molested by someone they knew were more likely to have forgotten their abuse 
this study also examined the reliability of recovered memories one in ten
women 16 percent of those who recalled the abuse reported that they had
forgotten it at some time in the past but later remembered that it had happened 
in comparison with the women who had always remembered their molestation 
those with a prior period of forgetting were younger at the time of their abuse
and were less likely to have received support from their mothers williams also
determined that the recovered memories were approximately as accurate as those
that had never been lost all the women s memories were accurate for the central
facts of the incident but none of their stories precisely matched every detail
documented in their charts 
21
williams s findings are supported by recent neuroscience research that
shows that memories that are retrieved tend to return to the memory bank with
modifications 
22
 as long as a memory is inaccessible the mind is unable to
change it but as soon as a story starts being told particularly if it is told
repeatedly it changes the act of telling itself changes the tale the mind cannot
help but make meaning out of what it knows and the meaning we make of our
lives changes how and what we remember 
given the wealth of evidence that trauma can be forgotten and resurface
years later why did nearly one hundred reputable memory scientists from
several different countries throw the weight of their reputations behind the
appeal to overturn father shanley s conviction claiming that repressed
memories were based on junk science because memory loss and delayed

recall of traumatic experiences had never been documented in the laboratory 
some cognitive scientists adamantly denied that these phenomena existed
23
 or
that retrieved traumatic memories could be accurate 
24
 however what doctors
encounter in emergency rooms on psychiatric wards and on the battlefield is
necessarily quite different from what scientists observe in their safe and well 
organized laboratories 
consider what is known as the lost in the mall experiment for example 
academic researchers have shown that it is relatively easy to implant memories
of events that never took place such as having been lost in a shopping mall as a
child 
25
 about 25 percent of subjects in these studies later recall that they were
frightened and even fill in missing details but such recollections involve none
of the visceral terror that a lost child would actually experience 
another line of research documented the unreliability of eyewitness
testimony subjects might be shown a video of a car driving down a street and
asked afterward if they saw a stop sign or a traffic light children might be asked
to recall what a male visitor to their classroom had been wearing other
eyewitness experiments demonstrated that the questions witnesses were asked
could alter what they claimed to remember these studies were valuable in
bringing many police and courtroom practices into question but they have little
relevance to traumatic memory 
the fundamental problem is this events that take place in the laboratory
cannot be considered equivalent to the conditions under which traumatic
memories are created the terror and helplessness associated with ptsd simply
can t be induced 
de novo
 in such a setting we can study the effects of existing
traumas in the lab as in our script driven imaging studies of flashbacks but the
original imprint of trauma cannot be laid down there dr roger pitman
conducted a study at harvard in which he showed college students a film called
faces of death
 which contained newsreel footage of violent deaths and
executions this movie now widely banned is as extreme as any institutional
review board would allow but it did not cause pitman s normal volunteers to
develop symptoms of ptsd if you want to study traumatic memory you have
to study the memories of people who have actually been traumatized 
interestingly once the excitement and profitability of courtroom testimony
diminished the scientific controversy disappeared as well and clinicians were
left to deal with the wreckage of traumatic memory 

normal versus traumatic memory
in 1994 i and my colleagues at massachusetts general hospital decided to
undertake a systematic study comparing how people recall benign experiences
and horrific ones we placed advertisements in local newspapers in
laundromats and on student union bulletin boards that said has something
terrible happened to you that you cannot get out of your mind call 727 5500 
we will pay you 10 00 for participating in this study in response to our first ad
seventy six volunteers showed up 
26
after we introduced ourselves we started off by asking each participant 
 can you tell us about an event in your life that you think you will always
remember but that is not traumatic one participant lit up and said the day
that my daughter was born others mentioned their wedding day playing on a
winning sports team or being valedictorian at their high school graduation then
we asked them to focus on specific sensory details of those events such as are
you ever somewhere and suddenly have a vivid image of what your husband
looked like on your wedding day the answers were always negative how
about what your husband s body felt like on your wedding night we got some
odd looks on that one we continued do you ever have a vivid precise
recollection of the speech you gave as a valedictorian do you ever have
intense sensations recalling the birth of your first child the replies were all in
the negative 
then we asked them about the traumas that had brought them into the study
 many of them rapes do you ever suddenly remember how your rapist
smelled we asked and do you ever experience the same physical sensations
you had when you were raped such questions precipitated powerful emotional
responses that is why i cannot go to parties anymore because the smell of
alcohol on somebody s breath makes me feel like i am being raped all over
again or i can no longer make love to my husband because when he touches
me in a particular way i feel like i am being raped again 
there were two major differences between how people talked about
memories of positive versus traumatic experiences 1 how the memories were
organized and 2 their physical reactions to them weddings births and
graduations were recalled as events from the past stories with a beginning a
middle and an end nobody said that there were periods when they d completely
forgotten any of these events 
in contrast the traumatic memories were disorganized our subjects

remembered some details all too clearly the smell of the rapist the gash in the
forehead of a dead child but could not recall the sequence of events or other
vital details the first person who arrived to help whether an ambulance or a
police car took them to the hospital 
we also asked the participants how they recalled their trauma at three points
in time right after it happened when they were most troubled by their
symptoms and during the week before the study all of our traumatized
participants said that they had not been able to tell anybody precisely what had
happened immediately following the event this will not surprise anyone who
has worked in an emergency room or ambulance service people brought in after
a car accident in which a child or a friend has been killed sit in stunned silence 
dumbfounded by terror almost all had repeated flashbacks they felt
overwhelmed by images sounds sensations and emotions as time went on 
even more sensory details and feelings were activated but most participants also
started to be able to make some sense out of them they began to know what
had happened and to be able to tell the story to other people a story that we call
 the memory of the trauma 
gradually the images and flashbacks decreased in frequency but the greatest
improvement was in the participants ability to piece together the details and
sequence of the event by the time of our study 85 percent of them were able to
tell a coherent story with a beginning a middle and an end only a few were
missing significant details we noted that the five who said they had been abused
as children had the most fragmented narratives their memories still arrived as
images physical sensations and intense emotions 
in essence our study confirmed the dual memory system that janet and his
colleagues at the salp tri re had described more than a hundred years earlier 
traumatic memories are fundamentally different from the stories we tell about
the past they are dissociated the different sensations that entered the brain at
the time of the trauma are not properly assembled into a story a piece of
autobiography 
perhaps the most important finding in our study was that remembering the
trauma with all its associated affects does not as breuer and freud claimed back
in 1893 necessarily resolve it our research did not support the idea that
language can substitute for action most of our study participants could tell a
coherent story and also experience the pain associated with those stories but
they kept being haunted by unbearable images and physical sensations research
in contemporary exposure treatment a staple of cognitive behavioral therapy 

has similarly disappointing results the majority of patients treated with that
method continue to have serious ptsd symptoms three months after the end of
treatment 
27
 as we will see finding words to describe what has happened to you
can be transformative but it does not always abolish flashbacks or improve
concentration stimulate vital involvement in your life or reduce hypersensitivity
to disappointments and perceived injuries 
listening to survivors
nobody wants to remember trauma in that regard society is no different from
the victims themselves we all want to live in a world that is safe manageable 
and predictable and victims remind us that this is not always the case in order
to understand trauma we have to overcome our natural reluctance to confront
that reality and cultivate the courage to listen to the testimonies of survivors 
in his book 
holocaust testimonies the ruins of memory
 1991 lawrence
langer writes about his work in the fortunoff video archive at yale university 
 listening to accounts of holocaust experience we unearth a mosaic of
evidence that constantly vanishes into bottomless layers of incompletion 
28
 we
wrestle with the beginnings of a permanently unfinished tale full of incomplete
intervals faced by the spectacle of a faltering witness often reduced to a
distressed silence by the overwhelming solicitations of deep memory as one of
his witnesses says if you were not there it s difficult to describe and say how it
was how men function under such stress is one thing and then how you
communicate and express that to somebody who never knew that such a degree
of brutality exists seems like a fantasy 
another survivor charlotte delbo describes her dual existence after
auschwitz t he self who was in the camp isn t me isn t the person who is
here opposite you no it s too unbelievable and everything that happened to
this other self the one from auschwitz doesn t touch me now 
me
 doesn t
concern me so distinct are deep memory and common memory without this
split i wouldn t have been able to come back to life

 she comments that even
words have a dual meaning otherwise someone in the camps who has been
tormented by thirst for weeks would never again be able to say i m thirsty 
let s make a cup of tea thirst after the war has once more become a currently
used term on the other hand if i dream of the thirst i felt in birkenau the
extermination facilities in auschwitz i see myself as i was then haggard bereft

of reason tottering 
30
langer hauntingly concludes who can find a proper grave for such
damaged mosaics of the mind where they may rest in pieces life goes on but
in two temporal directions at once the future unable to escape the grip of a
memory laden with grief 
31
the essence of trauma is that it is overwhelming unbelievable and
unbearable each patient demands that we suspend our sense of what is normal
and accept that we are dealing with a dual reality the reality of a relatively
secure and predictable present that lives side by side with a ruinous ever present
past 
nancy s story
few patients have put that duality into words as vividly as nancy the director of
nursing in a midwestern hospital who came to boston several times to consult
with me shortly after the birth of her third child nancy underwent what is
usually routine outpatient surgery a laparoscopic tubal ligation in which the
fallopian tubes are cauterized to prevent future pregnancies however because
she was given insufficient anesthesia she awakened after the operation began
and remained aware nearly to the end at times falling into what she called a
light sleep or dream at times experiencing the full horror of her situation 
she was unable to alert the or team by moving or crying out because she had
been given a standard muscle relaxant to prevent muscle contractions during
surgery 
some degree of anesthesia awareness is now estimated to occur in
approximately thirty thousand surgical patients in the united states every year 
32
and i had previously testified on behalf of several people who were traumatized
by the experience nancy however did not want to sue her surgeon or
anesthetist her entire focus was on bringing the reality of her trauma to
consciousness so that she could free herself from its intrusions into her everyday
life i d like to end this chapter by sharing several passages from a remarkable
series of e mails in which she described her grueling journey to recovery 
initially nancy did not know what had happened to her when we went
home i was still in a daze doing the typical things of running a household yet
not really feeling that i was alive or that i was real i had trouble sleeping that
night for days i remained in my own little disconnected world i could not use

a hair dryer toaster stove or anything that warmed up i could not concentrate
on what people were doing or telling me i just didn t care i was increasingly
anxious i slept less and less i knew i was behaving strangely and kept trying to
understand what was frightening me so 
 on the fourth night after the surgery around 3 am i started to realize that
the dream i had been living all this time related to conversations i had heard in
the operating room i was suddenly transported back into the or and could feel
my paralyzed body being burned i was engulfed in a world of terror and horror 
from then on nancy says memories and flashbacks erupted into her life 
 it was as if the door was pushed open slightly allowing the intrusion there
was a mixture of curiosity and avoidance i continued to have irrational fears i
was deathly afraid of sleep i experienced a sense of terror when seeing the color
blue my husband unfortunately was bearing the brunt of my illness i would
lash out at him when i truly did not intend to i was sleeping at most 2 to 3
hours and my daytime was filled with hours of flashbacks i remained
chronically hyperalert feeling threatened by my own thoughts and wanting to
escape them i lost 23 pounds in 3 weeks people kept commenting on how great
i looked 
 i began to think about dying i developed a very distorted view of my life
in which all my successes diminished and old failures were amplified i was
hurting my husband and found that i could not protect my children from my
rage 
 three weeks after the surgery i went back to work at the hospital the first
time i saw somebody in a surgical scrubsuit was in the elevator i wanted to get
out immediately but of course i could not i then had this irrational urge to
clobber him which i contained with considerable effort this episode triggered
increasing flashbacks terror and dissociation i cried all the way home from
work after that i became adept at avoidance i never set foot in an elevator i
never went to the cafeteria i avoided the surgical floors 
gradually nancy was able to piece together her flashbacks and create an
understandable if horrifying memory of her surgery she recalled the
reassurances of the or nurses and a brief period of sleep after the anesthesia was
started then she remembered how she began to awaken 
 the entire team was laughing about an affair one of the nurses was having 
this coincided with the first surgical incision i felt the stab of the scalpel then
the cutting then the warm blood flowing over my skin i tried desperately to
move to speak but my body didn t work i couldn t understand this i felt a

deeper pain as the layers of muscle pulled apart under their own tension i knew
i wasn t supposed to feel this 
nancy next recalls someone rummaging around in her belly and identified
this as the laparoscopic instruments being placed she felt her left tube being
clamped then suddenly there was an intense searing burning pain i tried to
escape but the cautery tip pursued me relentlessly burning through there
simply are no words to describe the terror of this experience this pain was not
in the same realm as other pain i had known and conquered like a broken bone
or natural childbirth it begins as extreme pain then continues relentlessly as it
slowly burns through the tube the pain of being cut with the scalpel pales
beside this giant 
 then abruptly the right tube felt the initial impact of the burning tip 
when i heard them laugh i briefly lost track of where i was i believed i was in
a torture chamber and i could not understand why they were torturing me
without even asking for information my world narrowed to a small sphere
around the operating table there was no sense of time no past and no future 
there was only pain terror and horror i felt isolated from all humanity 
profoundly alone in spite of the people surrounding me the sphere was closing
in on me 
 in my agony i must have made some movement i heard the nurse
anesthetist tell the anesthesiologist that i was light he ordered more meds and
then quietly said there is no need to put any of this in the chart that is the last
memory i recalled 
in her later e mails to me nancy struggled to capture the existential reality
of trauma 
 i want to tell you what a flashback is like it is as if time is folded or
warped so that the past and present merge as if i were physically transported
into the past symbols related to the original trauma however benign in reality 
are thoroughly contaminated and so become objects to be hated feared 
destroyed if possible avoided if not for example an iron in any form a toy a
clothes iron a curling iron came to be seen as an instrument of torture each
encounter with a scrub suit left me disassociated confused physically ill and at
times consciously angry 
 my marriage is slowly falling apart my husband came to represent the
heartless laughing people the surgical team who hurt me i exist in a dual state 
a pervasive numbness covers me with a blanket and yet the touch of a small
child pulls me back to the world for a moment i am present and a part of life 

not just an observer 
 interestingly i function very well at work and i am constantly given
positive feedback life proceeds with its own sense of falsity 
 there is a strangeness bizarreness to this dual existence i tire of it yet i
cannot give up on life and i cannot delude myself into believing that if i ignore
the beast it will go away i ve thought many times that i had recalled all the
events around the surgery only to find a new one 
 there are so many pieces of that 45 minutes of my life that remain
unknown my memories are still incomplete and fragmented but i no longer
think that i need to know everything in order to understand what happened 
 when the fear subsides i realize i can handle it but a part of me doubts that
i can the pull to the past is strong it is the dark side of my life and i must
dwell there from time to time the struggle may also be a way to know that i
survive a re playing of the fight to survive which apparently i won but
cannot own 
an early sign of recovery came when nancy needed another more extensive
operation she chose a boston hospital for the surgery asked for a preoperative
meeting with the surgeons and the anesthesiologist specifically to discuss her
prior experience and requested that i be allowed to join them in the operating
room for the first time in many years i put on a surgical scrub suit and
accompanied her into the or while the anesthesia was induced this time she
woke up to a feeling of safety 
two years later i wrote nancy asking her permission to use her account of
anesthesia awareness in this chapter in her reply she updated me on the progress
of her recovery i wish i could say that the surgery to which you were so kind to
accompany me ended my suffering that sadly was not the case after about six
more months i made two choices that proved provident i left my cbt therapist
to work with a psychodynamic psychiatrist and i joined a pilates class 
 in our last month of therapy i asked my psychiatrist why he did not try to
fix me as all other therapists had attempted yet had failed he told me that he
assumed given what i had be able to accomplish with my children and career 
that i had sufficient resiliency to heal myself if he created a holding
environment for me to do so this was an hour each week that became a refuge
where i could unravel the mystery of how i had become so damaged and then re 
construct a sense of myself that was whole not fragmented peaceful not
tormented through pilates i found a stronger physical core as well as a
community of women who willingly gave acceptance and social support that had

been distant in my life since the trauma this combination of core strengthening
 psychological social and physical created a sense of personal safety and
mastery relegating my memories to the distant past allowing the present and
future to emerge 

part five
paths to recovery

chapter 13
healing from trauma owning
your self
i don t go to therapy to find out if i m a freak
i go and i find the one and only answer every week
and when i talk about therapy i know what people think
that it only makes you selfish and in love with your shrink
but oh how i loved everybody else
when i finally got to talk so much about myself
 dar williams 
what do you hear in these sounds
obody can treat a war or abuse rape molestation or any other
horrendous event for that matter what has happened cannot be undone 
but what 
can
 be dealt with are the imprints of the trauma on body mind and
soul the crushing sensations in your chest that you may label as anxiety or
depression the fear of losing control always being on alert for danger or
rejection the self loathing the nightmares and flashbacks the fog that keeps
you from staying on task and from engaging fully in what you are doing being
unable to fully open your heart to another human being 
trauma robs you of the feeling that you are in charge of yourself of what i
will call self leadership in the chapters to come 
1
 the challenge of recovery is to
reestablish ownership of your body and your mind of your self this means
feeling free to know what you know and to feel what you feel without becoming
overwhelmed enraged ashamed or collapsed for most people this involves 1 
finding a way to become calm and focused 2 learning to maintain that calm in

response to images thoughts sounds or physical sensations that remind you of
the past 3 finding a way to be fully alive in the present and engaged with the
people around you 4 not having to keep secrets from yourself including
secrets about the ways that you have managed to survive 
these goals are not steps to be achieved one by one in some fixed
sequence they overlap and some may be more difficult than others depending
on individual circumstances in each of the chapters that follow i ll talk about
specific methods or approaches to accomplish them i have tried to make these
chapters useful both to trauma survivors and to the therapists who are treating
them people under temporary stress may also find them useful i ve used every
one of these methods extensively to treat my patients and i have also
experienced them myself some people get better using just one of these
methods but most are helped by different approaches at different stages of their
recovery 
i have done scientific studies of many of the treatments i describe here and
have published the research findings in peer reviewed scientific journals 
2
 my
aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of underlying principles a preview
of what s to come and some brief comments on methods i don t cover in depth
later on 
a new focus for recovery
when we talk about trauma we often start with a story or a question what
happened during the war were you ever molested let me tell you about
that accident or that rape or was anybody in your family a problem drinker 
however trauma is much more than a story about something that happened long
ago the emotions and physical sensations that were imprinted during the trauma
are experienced not as memories but as disruptive physical reactions in the
present 
in order to regain control over your self you need to revisit the trauma 
sooner or later you need to confront what has happened to you but only after
you feel safe and will not be retraumatized by it the first order of business is to
find ways to cope with feeling overwhelmed by the sensations and emotions
associated with the past 
as the previous parts of this book have shown the engines of posttraumatic
reactions are located in the emotional brain in contrast with the rational brain 

which expresses itself in thoughts the emotional brain manifests itself in
physical reactions gut wrenching sensations heart pounding breathing
becoming fast and shallow feelings of heartbreak speaking with an uptight and
reedy voice and the characteristic body movements that signify collapse 
rigidity rage or defensiveness 
why can t we just be reasonable and can understanding help the rational 
executive brain is good at helping us understand where feelings come from as
in i get scared when i get close to a guy because my father molested me or i
have trouble expressing my love toward my son because i feel guilty about
having killed a child in iraq however the rational brain cannot 
abolish
emotions sensations or thoughts such as living with a low level sense of threat
or feeling that you are fundamentally a terrible person even though you
rationally know that you are not to blame for having been raped understanding
why
 you feel a certain way does not change 
how
 you feel but it can keep you
from surrendering to intense reactions for example assaulting a boss who
reminds you of a perpetrator breaking up with a lover at your first disagreement 
or jumping into the arms of a stranger however the more frazzled we are the
more our rational brains take a backseat to our emotions 
3
limbic system therapy
the fundamental issue in resolving traumatic stress is to restore the proper
balance between the rational and emotional brains so that you can feel in charge
of how you respond and how you conduct your life when we re triggered into
states of hyper or hypoarousal we are pushed outside our window of
tolerance the range of optimal functioning 
4
 we become reactive and
disorganized our filters stop working sounds and lights bother us unwanted
images from the past intrude on our minds and we panic or fly into rages if
we re shut down we feel numb in body and mind our thinking becomes
sluggish and we have trouble getting out of our chairs 
as long as people are either hyperaroused or shut down they cannot learn
from experience even if they manage to stay in control they become so uptight
 alcoholics anonymous calls this white knuckle sobriety that they are
inflexible stubborn and depressed recovery from trauma involves the
restoration of executive functioning and with it self confidence and the capacity
for playfulness and creativity 

if we want to change posttraumatic reactions we have to access the
emotional brain and do limbic system therapy repairing faulty alarm systems
and restoring the emotional brain to its ordinary job of being a quiet background
presence that takes care of the housekeeping of the body ensuring that you eat 
sleep connect with intimate partners protect your children and defend against
danger 
drawing by licia sky
accessing the emotional brain 
 the rational analyzing part of the brain centered on the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex has no direct connections with the emotional brain where most imprints of trauma
reside but the medial prefrontal cortex the center of self awareness does 
the neuroscientist joseph ledoux and his colleagues have shown that the
only way we can consciously access the emotional brain is through self 
awareness 
i e 
 by activating the medial prefrontal cortex the part of the brain
that notices what is going on inside us and thus allows us to feel what we re
feeling 
5
 the technical term for this is 
interoception 
 latin for looking
inside most of our conscious brain is dedicated to focusing on the outside
world getting along with others and making plans for the future however that
does not help us manage ourselves neuroscience research shows that the only
way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our 
inner

experience and learning to befriend what is going inside ourselves 
befriending the emotional brain
1 dealing with hyperarousal
over the past few decades mainstream psychiatry has focused on using drugs to
change the way we feel and this has become the accepted way to deal with
hyper and hypoarousal i will discuss drugs later in this chapter but first i need
to stress the fact that we have a host of inbuilt skills to keep us on an even keel 
in chapter 5 we saw how emotions are registered in the body some 80 percent
of the fibers of the vagus nerve which connects the brain with many internal
organs are afferent that is they run from the body into the brain 
6
 this means
that we can directly train our arousal system by the way we breathe chant and
move a principle that has been utilized since time immemorial in places like
china and india and in every religious practice that i know of but that is
suspiciously eyed as alternative in mainstream culture 
in research supported by the national institutes of health my colleagues
and i have shown that ten weeks of yoga practice markedly reduced the ptsd
symptoms of patients who had failed to respond to any medication or to any
other treatment 
7
 i will discuss yoga in chapter 16 neurofeedback the topic of
chapter 19 also can be particularly effective for children and adults who are so
hyperaroused or shut down that they have trouble focusing and prioritizing 
8
learning how to breathe calmly and remaining in a state of relative physical
relaxation even while accessing painful and horrifying memories is an essential
tool for recovery 
9
 when you deliberately take a few slow deep breaths you will
notice the effects of the parasympathetic brake on your arousal as explained in
chapter 5 the more you stay focused on your breathing the more you will
benefit particularly if you pay attention until the very end of the out breath and
then wait a moment before you inhale again as you continue to breathe and
notice the air moving in and out of your lungs you may think about the role that
oxygen plays in nourishing your body and bathing your tissues with the energy
you need to feel alive and engaged chapter 16 documents the full body effects
of this simple practice 
since emotional regulation is the critical issue in managing the effects of
trauma and neglect it would make an enormous difference if teachers army
sergeants foster parents and mental health professionals were thoroughly

schooled in emotional regulation techniques right now this still is mainly the
domain of preschool and kindergarten teachers who deal with immature brains
and impulsive behavior on a daily basis and who are often very adept at
managing them 
10
mainstream western psychiatric and psychological healing traditions have
paid scant attention to self management in contrast to the western reliance on
drugs and verbal therapies other traditions from around the world rely on
mindfulness movement rhythms and action yoga in india tai chi and qigong
in china and rhythmical drumming throughout africa are just a few examples 
the cultures of japan and the korean peninsula have spawned martial arts 
which focus on the cultivation of purposeful movement and being centered in the
present abilities that are damaged in traumatized individuals aikido judo tae
kwon do kendo and jujitsu as well as capoeira from brazil are examples 
these techniques all involve physical movement breathing and meditation 
aside from yoga few of these popular non western healing traditions have been
systematically studied for the treatment of ptsd 
2 no mind without mindfulness
at the core of recovery is self awareness the most important phrases in trauma
therapy are notice that and what happens next traumatized people live
with seemingly unbearable sensations they feel heartbroken and suffer from
intolerable sensations in the pit of their stomach or tightness in their chest yet
avoiding feeling these sensations in our bodies increases our vulnerability to
being overwhelmed by them 
body awareness puts us in touch with our inner world the landscape of our
organism simply noticing our annoyance nervousness or anxiety immediately
helps us shift our perspective and opens up new options other than our
automatic habitual reactions mindfulness puts us in touch with the transitory
nature of our feelings and perceptions when we pay focused attention to our
bodily sensations we can recognize the ebb and flow of our emotions and with
that increase our control over them 
traumatized people are often afraid of feeling it is not so much the
perpetrators who hopefully are no longer around to hurt them but their own
physical sensations that now are the enemy apprehension about being hijacked
by uncomfortable sensations keeps the body frozen and the mind shut even
though the trauma is a thing of the past the emotional brain keeps generating

sensations that make the sufferer feel scared and helpless it s not surprising that
so many trauma survivors are compulsive eaters and drinkers fear making love 
and avoid many social activities their sensory world is largely off limits 
in order to change you need to open yourself to your inner experience the
first step is to allow your mind to focus on your sensations and notice how in
contrast to the timeless ever present experience of trauma physical sensations
are transient and respond to slight shifts in body position changes in breathing 
and shifts in thinking once you pay attention to your physical sensations the
next step is to label them as in when i feel anxious i feel a crushing sensation
in my chest i may then say to a patient focus on that sensation and see how it
changes when you take a deep breath out or when you tap your chest just below
your collarbone or when you allow yourself to cry practicing mindfulness
calms down the sympathetic nervous system so that you are less likely to be
thrown into fight or flight 
11
 learning to observe and tolerate your physical
reactions is a prerequisite for safely revisiting the past if you cannot tolerate
what you are feeling right now opening up the past will only compound the
misery and retraumatize you further 
12
we can tolerate a great deal discomfort as long as we stay conscious of the
fact that the body s commotions constantly shift one moment your chest
tightens but after you take a deep breath and exhale that feeling softens and you
may observe something else perhaps a tension in your shoulder now you can
start exploring what happens when you take a deeper breath and notice how your
rib cage expands 
13
 once you feel calmer and more curious you can go back to
that sensation in your shoulder you should not be surprised if a memory
spontaneously arises in which that shoulder was somehow involved 
a further step is to observe the interplay between your thoughts and your
physical sensations how are particular thoughts registered in your body do
thoughts like my father loves me or my girlfriend dumped me produce
different sensations becoming aware of how your body organizes particular
emotions or memories opens up the possibility of releasing sensations and
impulses you once blocked in order to survive 
14
 in chapter 20 on the benefits of
theater i ll describe in more detail how this works 
jon kabat zinn one of the pioneers in mind body medicine founded the
mindfulness based stress reduction mbsr program at the university of
massachusetts medical center in 1979 and his method has been thoroughly
studied for more than three decades as he describes mindfulness one way to
think of this process of transformation is to think of mindfulness as a lens taking

the scattered and reactive energies of your mind and focusing them into a
coherent source of energy for living for problem solving for healing 
15
mindfulness has been shown to have a positive effect on numerous
psychiatric psychosomatic and stress related symptoms including depression
and chronic pain 
16
 it has broad effects on physical health including
improvements in immune response blood pressure and cortisol levels 
17
 it has
also been shown to activate the brain regions involved in emotional regulation
18
and to lead to changes in the regions related to body awareness and fear 
19
research by my harvard colleagues britta h lzel and sara lazar has shown that
practicing mindfulness even decreases the activity of the brain s smoke detector 
the amygdala and thus decreases reactivity to potential triggers 
20
3 relationships
study after study shows that having a good support network constitutes the
single most powerful protection against becoming traumatized safety and terror
are incompatible when we are terrified nothing calms us down like the
reassuring voice or the firm embrace of someone we trust frightened adults
respond to the same comforts as terrified children gentle holding and rocking
and the assurance that somebody bigger and stronger is taking care of things so
you can safely go to sleep in order to recover mind body and brain need to be
convinced that it is safe to let go that happens only when you feel safe at a
visceral level and allow yourself to connect that sense of safety with memories
of past helplessness 
after an acute trauma like an assault accident or natural disaster survivors
require the presence of familiar people faces and voices physical contact food 
shelter and a safe place and time to sleep it is critical to communicate with
loved ones close and far and to reunite as soon as possible with family and
friends in a place that feels safe our attachment bonds are our greatest
protection against threat for example children who are separated from their
parents after a traumatic event are likely to suffer serious negative long term
effects studies conducted during world war ii in england showed that children
who lived in london during the blitz and were sent away to the countryside for
protection against german bombing raids fared much worse than children who
remained with their parents and endured nights in bomb shelters and frightening
images of destroyed buildings and dead people 
21
traumatized human beings recover in the context of relationships with

families loved ones aa meetings veterans organizations religious
communities or professional therapists the role of those relationships is to
provide physical and emotional safety including safety from feeling shamed 
admonished or judged and to bolster the courage to tolerate face and process
the reality of what has happened 
as we have seen much the wiring of our brain circuits is devoted to being
in tune with others recovery from trauma involves re connecting with our
fellow human beings this is why trauma that has occurred within relationships
is generally more difficult to treat than trauma resulting from traffic accidents or
natural disasters in our society the most common traumas in women and
children occur at the hands of their parents or intimate partners child abuse 
molestation and domestic violence all are inflicted by people who are supposed
to love you that knocks out the most important protection against being
traumatized being sheltered by the people you love 
if the people whom you naturally turn to for care and protection terrify or
reject you you learn to shut down and to ignore what you feel 
22
 as we saw in
part 3 when your caregivers turn on you you have to find alternative ways to
deal with feeling scared angry or frustrated managing your terror all by
yourself gives rise to another set of problems dissociation despair addictions a
chronic sense of panic and relationships that are marked by alienation 
disconnection and explosions patients with these histories rarely make the
connection between what happened to them long ago and how they currently feel
and behave everything just seems unmanageable 
relief does not come until they are able to acknowledge what has happened
and recognize the invisible demons they re struggling with recall for example 
the men i described in chapter 11 who had been abused by pedophile priests 
they visited the gym regularly took anabolic steroids and were strong as oxen 
however in our interviews they often acted like scared kids the hurt boys deep
inside still felt helpless 
while human contact and attunement are the wellspring of physiological
self regulation the promise of closeness often evokes fear of getting hurt 
betrayed and abandoned shame plays an important role in this you will find
out how rotten and disgusting i am and dump me as soon as you really get to
know me unresolved trauma can take a terrible toll on relationships if your
heart is still broken because you were assaulted by someone you loved you are
likely to be preoccupied with not getting hurt again and fear opening up to
someone new in fact you may unwittingly try to hurt them before they have a

chance to hurt you 
this poses a real challenge for recovery once you recognize that
posttraumatic reactions started off as efforts to save your life you may gather the
courage to face your inner music or cacophony but you will need help to do
so you have to find someone you can trust enough to accompany you someone
who can safely hold your feelings and help you listen to the painful messages
from your emotional brain you need a guide who is not afraid of your terror and
who can contain your darkest rage someone who can safeguard the wholeness
of you while you explore the fragmented experiences that you had to keep secret
from yourself for so long most traumatized individuals need an anchor and a
great deal of coaching to do this work 
choosing a professional therapist
the training of competent trauma therapists involves learning about the impact
of trauma abuse and neglect and mastering a variety of techniques that can help
to 1 stabilize and calm patients down 2 help to lay traumatic memories and
reenactments to rest and 3 reconnect patients with their fellow men and
women ideally the therapist will also have been on the receiving end of
whatever therapy he or she practices 
while it s inappropriate and unethical for therapists to tell you the details of
their personal struggles it is perfectly reasonable to ask what particular forms of
therapy they have been trained in where they learned their skills and whether
they ve personally benefited from the therapy they propose for you 
there is no one treatment of choice for trauma and any therapist who
believes that his or her particular method is the only answer to your problems is
suspect of being an ideologue rather than somebody who is interested in making
sure that you get well no therapist can possibly be familiar with every effective
treatment and he or she must be open to your exploring options other than the
ones he or she offers he or she also must be open to learning from you gender 
race and personal background are relevant only if they interfere with helping the
patient feel safe and understood 
do you feel basically comfortable with this therapist does he or she seem
to feel comfortable in his or her own skin and with you as a fellow human being 
feeling safe is a necessary condition for you to confront your fears and anxieties 
someone who is stern judgmental agitated or harsh is likely to leave you
feeling scared abandoned and humiliated and that won t help you resolve your

traumatic stress
 
there may be times as old feelings from the past are stirred up 
when you become suspicious that the therapist resembles someone who once
hurt or abused you hopefully this is something you can work through together 
because in my experience patients get better only if they develop deep positive
feelings for their therapists i also don t think that you can grow and change
unless you feel that you have some impact on the person who is treating you 
the critical question is this do you feel that your therapist is curious to find
out who 
you
 are and what 
you
 not some generic ptsd patient need are you
just a list of symptoms on some diagnostic questionnaire or does your therapist
take the time to find out why you do what you do and think what you think 
therapy is a collaborative process a mutual exploration of your self 
patients who have been brutalized by their caregivers as children often do
not feel safe with anyone i often ask my patients if they can think of any person
they felt safe with while they were growing up many of them hold tight to the
memory of that one teacher neighbor shopkeeper coach or minister who
showed that he or she cared and that memory is often the seed of learning to
reengage we are a hopeful species working with trauma is as much about
remembering how we survived as it is about what is broken 
i also ask my patients to imagine what they were like as newborns whether
they were lovable and filled with spunk all of them believe they were and have
some image of what they must have been like before they were hurt 
some people don t remember anybody they felt safe with for them 
engaging with horses or dogs may be much safer than dealing with human
beings this principle is currently being applied in many therapeutic settings to
great effect including in jails residential treatment programs and veterans 
rehabilitation jennifer a member of the first graduating class of the van der
kolk center 
23
 who had come to the program as an out of control mute
fourteen year old said during her graduation ceremony that having been
entrusted with the responsibility of caring for a horse was the critical first step
for her her growing bond with her horse helped her feel safe enough to begin to
relate to the staff of the center and then to focus on her classes take her sats 
and be accepted to college 
24
4 communal rhythms and synchrony
from the moment of our birth our relationships are embodied in responsive
faces gestures and touch as we saw in chapter 7 these are the foundations of

attachment trauma results in a breakdown of attuned physical synchrony when
you enter the waiting room of a ptsd clinic you can immediately tell the
patients from the staff by their frozen faces and collapsed but simultaneously
agitated bodies unfortunately many therapists ignore those physical
communications and focus only on the words with which their patients
communicate 
the healing power of community as expressed in music and rhythms was
brought home for me in the spring of 1997 when i was following the work of
the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa in some places we
visited terrible violence continued one day i attended a group for rape
survivors in the courtyard of a clinic in a township outside johannesburg we
could hear the sound of bullets being fired at a distance while smoke billowed
over the walls of the compound and the smell of teargas hung in the air later we
heard that forty people had been killed 
yet while the surroundings were foreign and terrifying i recognized this
group all too well the women sat slumped over sad and frozen like so many
rape therapy groups i had seen in boston i felt a familiar sense of helplessness 
and surrounded by collapsed people i felt myself mentally collapse as well 
then one of the women started to hum while gently swaying back and forth 
slowly a rhythm emerged bit by bit other women joined in soon the whole
group was singing moving and getting up to dance it was an astounding
transformation people coming back to life faces becoming attuned vitality
returning to bodies i made a vow to apply what i was seeing there and to study
how rhythm chanting and movement can help to heal trauma 
we will see more of this in chapter 20 on theater where i show how groups
of young people among them juvenile offenders and at risk foster kids 
gradually learn to work together and to depend on one another whether as
partners in shakespearean swordplay or as the writers and performers of full 
length musicals different patients have told me how much choral singing 
aikido tango dancing and kickboxing have helped them and i am delighted to
pass their recommendations on to other people i treat 
i learned another powerful lesson about rhythm and healing when clinicians
at the trauma center were asked to treat a five year old mute girl ying mee 
who had been adopted from an orphanage in china after months of failed
attempts to make contact with her my colleagues deborah rozelle and liz
warner realized that her rhythmical engagement system didn t work she could
not resonate with the voices and faces of the people around her that led them to

sensorimotor therapy 
25
the sensory integration clinic in watertown massachusetts is a wondrous
indoor playground filled with swings tubs full of multicolored rubber balls so
deep that you can make yourself disappear balance beams crawl spaces
fashioned from plastic tubing and ladders that lead to platforms from which you
can dive onto foam filled mats the staff bathed ying mee in the tub with plastic
balls that helped her feel sensations on her skin they helped her sway on
swings and crawl under weighted blankets after six weeks something shifted
 
and she started to talk 
26
ying mee s dramatic improvement inspired us to start a sensory integration
clinic at the trauma center which we now also use in our residential treatment
programs we have not yet explored how well sensory integration works for
traumatized adults but i regularly incorporate sensory integration experiences
and dance in my seminars 
learning to become attuned provides parents and their kids with the
visceral experience of reciprocity parent child interaction therapy pcit is an
interactive therapy that fosters this as is smart sensory motor arousal
regulation treatment developed by my colleagues at the trauma center 
27
when we play together we feel physically attuned and experience a sense of
connection and joy improvisation exercises such as those found at
 also are a marvelous way to help people connect in joy
and exploration the moment you see a group of grim faced people break out in
a giggle you know that the spell of misery has broken 
5 getting in touch
mainstream trauma treatment has paid scant attention to helping terrified people
to safely experience their sensations and emotions medications such as
serotonin reuptake blockers respiridol and seroquel increasingly have taken the
place of helping people to deal with their sensory world 
28
 however the most
natural way that we humans calm down our distress is by being touched hugged 
and rocked this helps with excessive arousal and makes us feel intact safe 
protected and in charge 

rembrandt van rijn 
 
christ healing the sick
 
gestures of comfort are universally recognizable and
reflect the healing power of attuned touch 
touch the most elementary tool that we have to calm down is proscribed
from most therapeutic practices yet you can t fully recover if you don t feel safe
in your skin therefore i encourage all my patients to engage in some sort of
bodywork be it therapeutic massage feldenkrais or craniosacral therapy 
i asked my favorite bodywork practitioner licia sky about her practice
with traumatized individuals here is some of what she told me i never begin a
bodywork session without establishing a personal connection i m not taking a
history i m not finding out how traumatized a person is or what happened to
them i check in where they are in their body right now i ask them if there is
anything they want me to pay attention to all the while i m assessing their
posture whether they look me in the eye how tense or relaxed they seem are
they connecting with me or not 
 the first decision i make is if they will feel safer face up or face down if i
don t know them i usually start face up i am very careful about draping very

careful to let them feel safe with whatever clothing they want to leave on these
are important boundaries to set up right at the beginning 
 then with my first touch i make firm safe contact nothing forced or
sharp nothing too fast the touch is slow easy for the client to follow gently
rhythmic it can be as strong as a handshake the first place i might touch is
their hand and forearm because that s the safest place to touch anybody the
place where they can touch you back 
 you have to meet their point of resistance the place that has the most
tension and meet it with an equal amount of energy that releases the frozen
tension you can t hesitate hesitation communicates a lack of trust in yourself 
slow movement careful attuning to the client is different from hesitation you
have to meet them with tremendous confidence and empathy let the pressure of
your touch meet the tension they are holding in their bodies 
what does bodywork do for people licia s reply just like you can thirst
for water you can thirst for touch it is a comfort to be met confidently deeply 
firmly gently responsively mindful touch and movement grounds people and
allows them to discover tensions that they may have held for so long that they
are no longer even aware of them when you are touched you wake up to the
part of your body that is being touched 
 the body is physically restricted when emotions are bound up inside 
people s shoulders tighten their facial muscles tense they spend enormous
energy on holding back their tears or any sound or movement that might betray
their inner state when the physical tension is released the feelings can be
released movement helps breathing to become deeper and as the tensions are
released expressive sounds can be discharged the body becomes freer 
breathing freer being in flow touch makes it possible to live in a body that can
move in response to being moved 
 people who are terrified need to get a sense of where their bodies are in
space and of their boundaries firm and reassuring touch lets them know where
those boundaries are what s outside them where their bodies end they
discover that they don t constantly have to wonder who and where they are 
they discover that their body is solid and that they don t have to be constantly
on guard touch lets them know that they are safe 
6 taking action
the body responds to extreme experiences by secreting stress hormones these

are often blamed for subsequent illness and disease however stress hormones
are meant to give us the strength and endurance to respond to extraordinary
conditions people who actively 
do
 something to deal with a disaster rescuing
loved ones or strangers transporting people to a hospital being part of a medical
team pitching tents or cooking meals utilize their stress hormones for their
proper purpose and therefore are at much lower risk of becoming traumatized 
 nonetheless everyone has his or her breaking point and even the best prepared
person may become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the challenge 
helplessness and immobilization keep people from utilizing their stress
hormones to defend themselves when that happens their hormones still are
being pumped out but the actions they re supposed to fuel are thwarted 
eventually the activation patterns that were meant to promote coping are turned
back against the organism and now keep fueling inappropriate fight flight and
freeze responses in order to return to proper functioning this persistent
emergency response must come to an end the body needs to be restored to a
baseline state of safety and relaxation from which it can mobilize to take action
in response to real danger 
my friends and teachers pat ogden and peter levine have each developed
powerful body based therapies sensorimotor psychotherapy
29
 and somatic
experiencing
30
 to deal with this issue in these treatment approaches the story of
what has happened takes a backseat to exploring physical sensations and
discovering the location and shape of the imprints of past trauma on the body 
before plunging into a full fledged exploration of the trauma itself patients are
helped to build up internal resources that foster safe access sensations and
emotions that overwhelmed them at the time of the trauma peter levine calls
this process 
pendulation
 gently moving in and out of accessing internal
sensations and traumatic memories in this way patients are helped to gradually
expand their window of tolerance 
once patients can tolerate being aware of their trauma based physical
experiences they are likely to discover powerful physical impulses like hitting 
pushing or running that arose during the trauma but were suppressed in order
to survive these impulses manifest themselves in subtle body movements such
as twisting turning or backing away amplifying these movements and
experimenting with ways to modify them begins the process of bringing the
incomplete trauma related action tendencies to completion and can eventually
lead to resolution of the trauma somatic therapies can help patients to relocate
themselves in the present by experiencing that it is safe to move feeling the

pleasure of taking effective action restores a sense of agency and a sense of
being able to actively defend and protect themselves 
back in 1893 pierre janet the first great explorer of trauma wrote about
 the pleasure of completed action and i regularly observe that pleasure when i
practice sensorimotor psychotherapy and somatic experiencing when patients
can physically experience what it would have felt like to fight back or run away 
they relax smile and express a sense of completion 
when people are forced to submit to overwhelming power as is true for
most abused children women trapped in domestic violence and incarcerated
men and women they often survive with resigned compliance the best way to
overcome ingrained patterns of submission is to restore a physical capacity to
engage and defend one of my favorite body oriented ways to build effective
fight flight responses is our local impact center s model mugging program in
which women and increasingly men are taught to actively fight off a simulated
attack 
31
 the program started in oakland california in 1971 after a woman with
a fifth degree black belt in karate was raped wondering how this could have
happened to someone who supposedly could kill with her bare hands her friends
concluded that she had become de skilled by fear in the terms of this book her
executive functions her frontal lobes went off line and she froze the model
mugging program teaches women to recondition the freeze response through
many repetitions of being placed in the zero hour a military term for the
precise moment of an attack and learning to transform fear into positive fighting
energy 
one of my patients a college student with a history of unrelenting child
abuse took the course when i first met her she was collapsed depressed and
overly compliant three months later during her graduation ceremony she
successfully fought off a gigantic male attacker who ended up lying cringing on
the floor shielded from her blows by a thick protective suit while she faced
him arms raised in a karate stance calmly and clearly yelling no 
not long afterward she was walking home from the library after midnight
when three men jumped out of some bushes yelling bitch give us your
money she later told me that she took that same karate stance and yelled back 
 okay guys i ve been looking forward to this moment who wants to take me
on first they ran away if you re hunched over and too afraid to look around 
you are easy prey to other people s sadism but when you walk around projecting
the message don t mess with me you re not likely to be bothered 

integrating traumatic memories
people cannot put traumatic events behind until they are able to acknowledge
what has happened and start to recognize the invisible demons they re struggling
with traditional psychotherapy has focused mainly on constructing a narrative
that explains why a person feels a particular way or as sigmund freud put it
back in 1914 in 
remembering repeating and working through 
32
 while the
patient lives the trauma through as something real and actual we have to
accomplish the therapeutic task which consists chiefly of translating it back
again in terms of the past telling the story is important without stories 
memory becomes frozen and without memory you cannot imagine how things
can be different but as we saw in part 4 telling a story about the event does not
guarantee that the traumatic memories will be laid to rest 
there is a reason for that when people remember an ordinary event they
do not also relive the physical sensations emotions images smells or sounds
associated with that event in contrast when people fully recall their traumas 
they have the experience they are engulfed by the sensory or emotional
elements of the past the brain scans of stan and ute lawrence the accident
victims in chapter 4 show how this happens when stan was remembering his
horrendous accident two key areas in his brain went blank the area that
provides a sense of time and perspective which makes it possible to know that
 that was then but i am safe now and another area that integrates the images 
sounds and sensations of trauma into a coherent story when those parts of the
brain are knocked out you experience something not as an event with a
beginning a middle and an end but in fragments of sensations images and
emotions 
a trauma can be successfully processed only if all those brain structures are
kept online in stan s case eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
 emdr allowed him to access his memories of the accident without being
overwhelmed by them when the brain areas whose absence is responsible for
flashbacks can be kept online while remembering what has happened people can
integrate their traumatic memories as belonging to the past 
ute s dissociation as you recall she shut down completely complicated
recovery in a different way none of the brain structures necessary to engage in
the present were online so that dealing with the trauma was simply impossible 
without a brain that is alert and present there can be no integration and
resolution she needed to be helped to increase her window of tolerance before

she could deal with her ptsd symptoms 
hypnosis was the most widely practiced treatment for trauma from the late
1800s the time of pierre janet and sigmund freud until after world war ii on
youtube you can still watch the documentary 
let there be light
 by the great
hollywood director john huston which shows men undergoing hypnosis to treat
 war neurosis hypnosis fell out of favor in the early 1990s and there have been
no recent studies of its effectiveness for treating ptsd however hypnosis can
induce a state of relative calm from which patients can observe their traumatic
experiences without being overwhelmed by them since that capacity to quietly
observe oneself is a critical factor in the integration of traumatic memories it is
likely that hypnosis in some form will make a comeback 
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt 
during their training most psychologists are taught cognitive behavioral therapy 
cbt was first developed to treat phobias such as fear of spiders airplanes or
heights to help patients compare their irrational fears with harmless realities 
patients are gradually desensitized from their irrational fears by bringing to mind
what they are most afraid of using their narratives and images imaginal
exposure or they are placed in actual but actually safe anxiety provoking
situations in vivo exposure or they are exposed to virtual reality computer 
simulated scenes for example in the case of combat related ptsd fighting in
the streets of fallujah 
the idea behind cognitive behavioral treatment is that when patients are
repeatedly exposed to the stimulus without bad things actually happening they
gradually will become less upset the bad memories will have become associated
with corrective information of being safe 
33
 cbt also tries to help patients
deal with their tendency to avoid as in i don t want to talk about it 
34
 it sounds
simple but as we have seen reliving trauma reactivates the brain s alarm
system and knocks out critical brain areas necessary for integrating the past 
making it likely that patients will relive rather than resolve the trauma 
prolonged exposure or flooding has been studied more thoroughly than
any other ptsd treatment patients are asked to focus their attention on the
traumatic material and not distract themselves with other thoughts or
activities 
35
 research has shown that up to one hundred minutes of flooding in
which anxiety provoking triggers are presented in an intense sustained form are

required before decreases in anxiety are reported 
36
 exposure sometimes helps to
deal with fear and anxiety but it has not been proven to help with guilt or other
complex emotions 
37
in contrast to its effectiveness for irrational fears such as spiders cbt has
not done so well for traumatized individuals particularly those with histories of
childhood abuse only about one in three participants with ptsd who finish
research studies show some improvement 
38
 those who complete cbt treatment
usually have fewer ptsd symptoms but they rarely recover completely most
continue to have substantial problems with their health work or mental well 
being 
39
in the largest published study of cbt for ptsd more than one third of the
patients dropped out the rest had a significant number of adverse reactions 
most of the women in the study still suffered from full blown ptsd after three
months in the study and only 15 percent no longer had major ptsd
symptoms 
40
 a thorough analysis of all the scientific studies of cbt show that it
works about as well as being in a supportive therapy relationship 
41
 the poorest
outcome in exposure treatments occurs in patients who suffer from mental
defeat those who have given up 
42
being traumatized is not just an issue of being stuck in the past it is just as
much a problem of not being fully alive in the present one form of exposure
treatment is virtual reality therapy in which veterans wear high tech goggles that
make it possible to refight the battle of fallujah in lifelike detail as far as i
know the us marines performed very well in combat the problem is that they
cannot tolerate being home recent studies of australian combat veterans show
that their brains are rewired to be alert for emergencies at the expense of being
focused on the small details of everyday life 
43
 we ll learn more about this in
chapter 19 on neurofeedback more than virtual reality therapy traumatized
patients need real world therapy which helps them to feel as alive when
walking through the local supermarket or playing with their kids as they did in
the streets of baghdad 
patients can benefit from reliving their trauma only if they are not
overwhelmed by it a good example is a study of vietnam veterans conducted in
the early 1990s by my colleague roger pitman 
44
 i visited roger s lab every
week during that time since we were conducting the study of brain opioids in
ptsd that i discussed in chapter 2 roger would show me the videotapes of his
treatment sessions and we would discuss what we observed he and his

colleagues pushed the veterans to talk repeatedly about every detail of their
experiences in vietnam but the investigators had to stop the study because many
patients became panicked by their flashbacks and the dread often persisted after
the sessions some never returned while many of those who stayed with the
study became more depressed violent and fearful some coped with their
increased symptoms by increasing their alcohol consumption which led to
further violence and humiliation as some of their families called the police to
take them to a hospital 
desensitization
over the past two decades the prevailing treatment taught to psychology students
has been some form of systematic desensitization helping patients become less
reactive to certain emotions and sensations but is this the correct goal maybe
the issue is not desensitization but integration putting the traumatic event into its
proper place in the overall arc of one s life 
desensitization makes me think of the small boy he must have been about
five i saw in front of my house recently his hulking father was yelling at him
at the top of his voice as the boy rode his tricycle down my street the kid was
unfazed while my heart was racing and i felt an impulse to deck the guy how
much brutality had it taken to numb a child this young to his father s brutality 
his indifference to his father s yelling must have been the result of prolonged
exposure but i wondered at what price yes we can take drugs that blunt our
emotions or we can learn to desensitize ourselves as medical students we
learned to stay analytical when we had to treat children with third degree burns 
but as the neuroscientist jean decety at the university of chicago has shown 
desensitization to our own or to other people s pain tends to lead to an overall
blunting of emotional sensitivity 
45
a 2010 report on 49 425 veterans with newly diagnosed ptsd from the iraq
and afghanistan wars who sought care from the va showed that fewer than one
out of ten actually completed the recommended treatment 
46
 as in pitman s
vietnam veterans exposure treatment as currently practiced rarely works for
them we can only process horrendous experiences if they do not overwhelm
us and that means that other approaches are necessary 

drugs to safely access trauma 
when i was a medical student i spent the summer of 1966 working for jan
bastiaans a professor at leiden university in the netherlands who was known
for his work treating holocaust survivors with lsd he claimed to have
achieved spectacular results but when colleagues inspected his archives they
found few data to support his claims the potential of mind altering substances
for trauma treatment was subsequently neglected until 2000 when michael
mithoefer and his colleagues in south carolina received fda permission to
conduct an experiment with mdma ecstasy mdma was classified as a
controlled substance in 1985 after having been used for years as a recreational
drug as with prozac and other psychotropic agents we don t know exactly how
mdma works but it is known to increase concentrations of a number of
important hormones including oxytocin vasopressin cortisol and prolactin 
47
most relevant for trauma treatment it increases people s awareness of
themselves they frequently report a heightened sense of compassionate energy 
accompanied by curiosity clarity confidence creativity and connectedness 
mithoefer and his colleagues were looking for a medication that would enhance
the effectiveness of psychotherapy and they became interested in mdma
because it decreases fear defensiveness and numbing as well as helping to
access inner experience 
48
 they thought mdma might enable patients to stay
within the window of tolerance so they could revisit their traumatic memories
without suffering overwhelming physiological and emotional arousal 
the initial pilot studies have supported that expectation 
49
 the first study 
involving combat veterans firefighters and police officers with ptsd had
positive results in the next study of a group of twenty victims of assault who
had been unresponsive to previous forms of therapy twelve subjects received
mdma and eight received an inactive placebo sitting or lying in a comfortable
room they then all received two eight hour psychotherapy sessions mainly
using internal family systems ifs therapy the subject of chapter 17 of this
book two months later 83 percent of the patients who received mdma plus
psychotherapy were considered completely cured compared with 25 percent of
the placebo group none of the patients had adverse side effects perhaps most
interesting when the participants were interviewed more than a year after the
study was completed they had maintained their gains 
by being able to observe the trauma from the calm mindful state that ifs
calls self a term i ll discuss further in chapter 17 mind and brain are in a

position to integrate the trauma into the overall fabric of life this is very
different from traditional desensitization techniques which are about blunting a
person s response to past horrors this is about association and integration 
making a horrendous event that overwhelmed you in the past into a memory of
something that happened a long time ago 
nonetheless psychedelic substances are powerful agents with a troubled
history they can easily be misused through careless administration and poor
maintenance of therapeutic boundaries it is to be hoped that mdma will not be
another magic cure released from pandora s box 
what about medications 
people have always used drugs to deal with traumatic stress each culture and
each generation has its preferences gin vodka beer or whiskey hashish 
marijuana cannabis or ganja cocaine opioids like oxycontin tranquilizers such
as valium xanax and klonopin when people are desperate they will do just
about anything to feel calmer and more in control 
50
mainstream psychiatry follows this tradition over the past decade the
departments of defense and veterans affairs combined have spent over 4 5
billion on antidepressants antipsychotics and antianxiety drugs a june 2010
internal report from the defense department s pharmacoeconomic center at fort
sam houston in san antonio showed that 213 972 or 20 percent of the 1 1
million active duty troops surveyed were taking some form of psychotropic
drug antidepressants antipsychotics sedative hypnotics or other controlled
substances 
51
however drugs cannot cure trauma they can only dampen the
expressions of a disturbed physiology and they do not teach the lasting lessons
of self regulation they can help to control feelings and behavior but always at a
price because they work by blocking the chemical systems that regulate
engagement motivation pain and pleasure some of my colleagues remain
optimistic i keep attending meetings where serious scientists discuss their quest
for the elusive magic bullet that will miraculously reset the fear circuits of the
brain as if traumatic stress involved only one simple brain circuit i also
regularly prescribe medications 
just about every group of psychotropic agents has been used to treat some
aspect of ptsd 
52
 the serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris such as prozac 

zoloft effexor and paxil have been most thoroughly studied and they can make
feelings less intense and life more manageable patients on ssris often feel
calmer and more in control feeling less overwhelmed often makes it easier to
engage in therapy other patients feel blunted by ssris they feel they re
 losing their edge i approach it as an empirical question let s see what works 
and only the patient can be the judge of that on the other hand if one ssri does
not work it s worth trying another because they all have slightly different
effects it s interesting that the ssris are widely used to treat depression but in a
study in which we compared prozac with eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing emdr for patients with ptsd many of whom were also
depressed emdr proved to be a more effective antidepressant than prozac 
53
i ll return to that subject in chapter 15 
54
medicines that target the autonomic nervous system like propranolol or
clonidine can help to decrease hyperarousal and reactivity to stress 
55
 this
family of drugs works by blocking the physical effects of adrenaline the fuel of
arousal and thus reduces nightmares insomnia and reactivity to trauma
triggers 
56
 blocking adrenaline can help to keep the rational brain online and
make choices possible is this really what i want to do since i have started to
integrate mindfulness and yoga into my practice i use these medications less
often except occasionally to help patients sleep more restfully 
traumatized patients tend to like tranquilizing drugs benzodiazepines like
klonopin valium xanax and ativan in many ways they work like alcohol in
that they make people feel calm and keep them from worrying casino owners
love customers on benzodiazepines they don t get upset when they lose and
keep gambling but also like alcohol benzos weaken inhibitions against saying
hurtful things to people we love most civilian doctors are reluctant to prescribe
these drugs because they have a high addiction potential and they may also
interfere with trauma processing patients who stop taking them after prolonged
use usually have withdrawal reactions that make them agitated and increase
posttraumatic symptoms 
i sometimes give my patients low doses of benzodiazepines to use as
needed but not enough to take on a daily basis they have to choose when to use
up their precious supply and i ask them to keep a diary of what was going on
when they decided to take the pill that gives us a chance to discuss the specific
incidents that triggered them 
a few studies have shown that anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers such as
lithium or valproate can have mildly positive effects taking the edge off

hyperarousal and panic 
57
 the most controversial medications are the so called
second generation antipsychotic agents such as risperdal and seroquel the
largest selling psychiatric drugs in the united states 14 6 billion in 2008 low
doses of these agents can be helpful in calming down combat veterans and
women with ptsd related to childhood abuse 
58
 using these drugs is sometimes
justified for example when patients feel completely out of control and unable to
sleep or where other methods have failed 
59
 but it s important to keep in mind
that these medications work by blocking the dopamine system the brain s
reward system which also functions as the engine of pleasure and motivation 
antipsychotic medications such as risperdal abilify or seroquel can
significantly dampen the emotional brain and thus make patients less skittish or
enraged but they also may interfere with being able to appreciate subtle signals
of pleasure danger or satisfaction they also cause weight gain increase the
chance of developing diabetes and make patients physically inert which is
likely to further increase their sense of alienation these drugs are widely used to
treat abused children who are inappropriately diagnosed with bipolar disorder or
mood dysregulation disorder more than half a million children and adolescents
in america are now taking antipsychotic drugs which may calm them down but
also interfere with learning age appropriate skills and developing friendships
with other children 
60
 a columbia university study recently found that
prescriptions of antipsychotic drugs for privately insured two to five year olds
had doubled between 2000 and 2007 
61
 only 40 percent of them had received a
proper mental health assessment 
until it lost its patent the pharmaceutical company johnson johnson
doled out lego blocks stamped with the word risperdal for the waiting
rooms of child psychiatrists children from low income families are four times
as likely as the privately insured to receive antipsychotic medicines in one year
alone texas medicaid spent 96 million on antipsychotic drugs for teenagers and
children including three unidentified infants who were given the drugs before
their first birthdays 
62
 there have been no studies on the effects of psychotropic
medications on the developing brain dissociation self mutilation fragmented
memories and amnesia generally do not respond to any of these medications 
the prozac study that i discussed in chapter 2 was the first to discover that
traumatized civilians tend to respond much better to medications than do combat
veterans 
63
 since then other studies have found similar discrepancies in this
light it is worrisome that the department of defense and the va prescribe

enormous quantities of medications to combat soldiers and returning veterans 
often without providing other forms of therapy between 2001 and 2011 the va
spent about 1 5 billion on seroquel and risperdal while defense spent about
 90 million during the same period even though a research paper published in
2001 showed that risperdal was no more effective than a placebo in treating
ptsd 
64
 similarly between 2001 and 2012 the va spent 72 1 million and
defense spent 44 1 million on benzodiazepines
65
 medications that clinicians
generally avoid prescribing to civilians with ptsd because of their addiction
potential and lack of significant effectiveness for ptsd symptoms 
the road of recovery is the road of life
in the first chapter of this book i introduced you to a patient named bill whom i
met over thirty years ago at the va bill became one of my longtime patient 
teachers and our relationship is also the story of my evolution of trauma
treatment
 
bill had served as a medic in vietnam in 1967 71 and after he returned he
tried to use the skills he had learned in the army by working on a burn unit in a
local hospital nursing kept him frazzled explosive and on edge but he had no
idea that these problems had anything to do with what he had experienced in
vietnam after all the ptsd diagnosis did not yet exist and irish working class
guys in boston didn t consult shrinks his nightmares and insomnia subsided a
bit after he left nursing and enrolled in a seminary to become a minister he did
not seek help until after his first son was born in 1978 
the baby s crying triggered unrelenting flashbacks in which he saw heard 
and smelled burned and mutilated children in vietnam he was so out of control
that some of my colleagues at the va wanted to put him in the hospital to treat
what they thought was a psychosis however as he and i started to work
together and he began to feel safe with me he gradually opened up about what
he had witnessed in vietnam and he slowly started to tolerate his feelings
without becoming overwhelmed this helped him to refocus on taking care of
his family and on finishing his training as a minister after two years he was a
pastor with his own parish and we felt that our work was done 
i had no further contact with bill until he called me up eighteen years to the
day after i first met him he was experiencing exactly the same symptoms 
flashbacks terrible nightmares feelings that he was going crazy that he d had

right after his baby was born that son had just turned eighteen and bill had
accompanied him to register for the draft at the same armory from which bill
himself had been shipped off to vietnam by then i knew much more about
treating traumatic stress and bill and i dealt with the specific memories of what
he had seen heard and smelled back in vietnam details that he had been too
scared to recall when we first met we could now integrate these memories with
emdr so that they became stories of what happened long ago instead of instant
transports into the hell of vietnam once he felt more settled he wanted to deal
with his childhood his brutal upbringing and his guilt about having left behind
his younger schizophrenic brother when he enlisted for vietnam unprotected
against their father s violent outbursts 
another important theme of our time together was the day to day pain bill
confronted as a minister having to bury adolescents killed in car crashes only a
few years after he d baptized them or having couples he d married come back in
crisis over domestic violence bill went on to organize a support group for
fellow clergy faced with similar traumas and he became an important force in
his community 
bill s third treatment started five years later when he developed a serious
neurological illness at age fifty three he had suddenly started to experience
episodic paralysis in several parts of his body and he was beginning to accept
that he would probably spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair i thought his
problems might be due to multiple sclerosis but his neurologists could not find
specific lesions and they said there was no cure for his condition he told me
how grateful he was for his wife s support she already had arranged to have a
wheelchair ramp built to the kitchen entrance to their house 
given his grim prognosis i urged bill to find a way to fully feel and
befriend the distressing feelings in his body just as he had learned to tolerate and
live with his most painful memories of the war i suggested that he consult a
body worker who had introduced me to feldenkrais a gentle hands on approach
to rearranging physical sensations and muscle movements when bill came back
to report on how he was doing he expressed delight with his increased sense of
control i mentioned that i d recently started to do yoga myself and that we had
just opened up a yoga program at the trauma center i invited him to explore
that as his next step 
bill found a local bikram yoga class a hot and intense practice usually
reserved for young and energetic people bill loved it even though parts of his
body occasionally gave way in class despite his physical disability he gained a

sense of bodily pleasure and mastery that he had never felt before 
bill s psychological treatment had helped him put the horrendous experience
of vietnam in the past now befriending his body was keeping him from
organizing his life around the loss of physical control he decided to become
certified as a yoga instructor and he began teaching yoga at his local armory to
the veterans who were returning from iraq and afghanistan 
today ten years later bill continues to be fully engaged in life with his
children and grandchildren through his work with veterans and in his church 
he copes with his physical limitations as an inconvenience to date he has
taught yoga classes to more than 1 300 returning combat veterans he still
regularly suffers from the sudden weakness in his limbs that requires him to sit
or lie down but like his memories of childhood and vietnam these episodes do
not dominate his existence they are simply part of the ongoing evolving story
of his life

 marion woodman as quoted by stephen cope in 
the great work of your life
 
n september 2001 several organizations including the national institutes of
health pfizer pharmaceuticals and the new york times company
foundation organized expert panels to recommend the best treatments for
people traumatized by the attacks on the world trade center because many
widely used trauma interventions had never been carefully evaluated in random
communities as opposed to patients who seek psychiatric help i thought that
this presented an extraordinary opportunity to compare how well a variety of
different approaches would work my colleagues were more conservative and
after lengthy deliberations the committees recommended only two forms of
treatment psychoanalytically oriented therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy 
why analytic talk therapy since manhattan is one of the last bastions of

freudian psychoanalysis it would have been bad politics to exclude a substantial
proportion of local mental health practitioners why cbt because behavioral
treatment can be broken down into concrete steps and manualized into
uniform protocols it is the favorite treatment of academic researchers another
group that could not be ignored after the recommendations were approved we
sat back and waited for new yorkers to find their way to therapists offices 
almost nobody showed up 
dr spencer eth who ran the psychiatry department at the now defunct st 
vincent s hospital in greenwich village was curious where survivors had
turned for help and early in 2002 together with some medical students he
conducted a survey of 225 people who had escaped from the twin towers 
asked what had been most helpful in overcoming the effects of their experience 
the survivors credited acupuncture massage yoga and emdr in that order 
1
among rescue workers massages were particularly popular eth s survey
suggests that the most helpful interventions focused on relieving the physical
burdens generated by trauma the disparity between the survivors experience
and the experts recommendations is intriguing of course we don t know how
many survivors eventually did seek out more traditional therapies but the
apparent lack of interest in talk therapy raises a basic question what good is it
to talk about your trauma 
the unspeakable truth
therapists have an undying faith in the capacity of talk to resolve trauma that
confidence dates back to 1893 when freud and his mentor breuer wrote that
trauma immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in
bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and
in arousing its accompanying affect and when the patient had described that
event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into words 
2
unfortunately it s not so simple traumatic events are almost impossible to
put into words this is true for all of us not just for people who suffer from
ptsd the initial imprints of the events of september 11 were not stories but
images frantic people running down the street their faces covered with ash an
airplane smashing into tower one of the world trade center the distant specks
that were people jumping hand in hand those images were replayed over and
over in our minds and on the tv screen until mayor giuliani and the media

helped us create a narrative we could share with one another 
in 
seven pillars of wisdom
 t e lawrence wrote of his war experiences 
 we learned that there were pangs too sharp griefs too deep ecstasies too high
for our finite selves to register when emotion reached this pitch the mind
choked and memory went white till the circumstances were humdrum once
more 
3
 while trauma keeps us dumbfounded the path out of it is paved with
words carefully assembled piece by piece until the whole story can be
revealed 
breaking the silence
activists in the early campaign for aids awareness created a powerful slogan 
 silence death silence about trauma also leads to death the death of the
soul silence reinforces the godforsaken isolation of trauma being able to say
aloud to another human being i was raped or i was battered by my husband 
or my parents called it discipline but it was abuse or i m not making it since
i got back from iraq is a sign that healing can begin 
we may think we can control our grief our terror or our shame by
remaining silent but naming offers the possibility of a different kind of control 
when adam was put in charge of the animal kingdom in the book of genesis 
his first act was to give a name to every living creature 
if you ve been hurt you need to acknowledge and name what happened to
you i know that from personal experience as long as i had no place where i
could let myself know what it was like when my father locked me in the cellar of
our house for various three year old offenses i was chronically preoccupied
with being exiled and abandoned only when i could talk about how that little
boy felt only when i could forgive him for having been as scared and
submissive as he was did i start to enjoy the pleasure of my own company 
feeling listened to and understood changes our physiology being able to
articulate a complex feeling and having our feelings recognized lights up our
limbic brain and creates an aha moment in contrast being met by silence and
incomprehension kills the spirit or as john bowlby so memorably put it what
can not be spoken to the m other cannot be told to the self 
if you hide from yourself the fact that an uncle molested you when you were
young you are vulnerable to react to triggers like an animal in a thunderstorm 
with a full body response to the hormones that signal danger without

language and context your awareness may be limited to i m scared yet 
determined to stay in control you are likely to avoid anybody or anything that
reminds you even vaguely of your trauma you may also alternate between being
inhibited and being uptight or reactive and explosive all without knowing why 
as long as you keep secrets and suppress information you are
fundamentally at war with yourself hiding your core feelings takes an enormous
amount of energy it saps your motivation to pursue worthwhile goals and it
leaves you feeling bored and shut down meanwhile stress hormones keep
flooding your body leading to headaches muscle aches problems with your
bowels or sexual functions and irrational behaviors that may embarrass you
and hurt the people around you only after you identify the source of these
responses can you start using your feelings as signals of problems that require
your urgent attention 
ignoring inner reality also eats away at your sense of self identity and
purpose clinical psychologist edna foa and her colleagues developed the
posttraumatic cognitions inventory to assess how patients think about
themselves 
4
 symptoms of ptsd often include statements like i feel dead
inside i will never be able to feel normal emotions again i have
permanently changed for the worse i feel like an object not like a person i
have no future and i feel like i don t know myself anymore 
the critical issue is allowing yourself to know what you know that takes an
enormous amount of courage in 
what it is like to go to war
 vietnam veteran
karl marlantes grapples with his memories of belonging to a brilliantly effective
marine combat unit and confronts the terrible split he discovered inside himself 
for years i was unaware of the need to heal that split and there was no
one after i returned to point this out to me why did i assume there
was only one person inside me there s a part of me that just loves
maiming killing and torturing this part of me isn t all of me i have
other elements that indeed are just the opposite of which i am proud 
so am i a killer no but part of me is am i a torturer no but part of
me is do i feel horror and sadness when i read in the newspapers of an
abused child yes but am i fascinated 
5
marlantes tells us that his road to recovery required learning to tell the truth 
even if that truth was brutally painful 
death destruction and sorrow need to be constantly justified in the absence

of some overarching meaning for the suffering lack of this overarching
meaning encourages making things up lying to fill the gap in meaning 
6
i d never been able to tell anyone what was going on inside so i forced
these images back away for years i began to reintegrate that split off
part of my experience only after i actually began to imagine that kid as
a kid my kid perhaps then out came this overwhelming sadness and
healing integrating the feelings of sadness rage or all of the above
with the action should be standard operating procedure for all soldiers
who have killed face to face it requires no sophisticated psychological
training just form groups under a fellow squad or platoon member who
has had a few days of group leadership training and encourage people
to talk 
7
getting perspective on your terror and sharing it with others can reestablish
the feeling that you are a member of the human race after the vietnam veterans
i treated joined a therapy group where they could share the atrocities they had
witnessed and committed they reported beginning to open their hearts to their
girlfriends 
the miracle of self discovery
discovering your self in language is always an epiphany even if finding the
words to describe your inner reality can be an agonizing process that is why i
find helen keller s account of how she was born into language 
8
 so inspiring 
when helen was nineteen months old and just starting to talk a viral
infection robbed her of her sight and hearing now deaf blind and mute this
lovely lively child turned into an untamed isolated creature after five desperate
years her family invited a partially blind teacher anne sullivan to come from
boston to their home in rural alabama as helen s tutor anne began immediately
to teach helen the manual alphabet spelling words into her hand letter by letter 
but it took ten weeks of trying to connect with this wild child before the
breakthrough occurred it came as anne spelled the word water into one of
helen s hands while she held the other under the water pump 
helen later recalled that moment in 
the story of my life
 water that word
startled my soul and it awoke full of the spirit of the morning until that day

my mind had been like a darkened chamber waiting for words to enter and light
the lamp which is thought i learned a great many words that day 
learning the names of things enabled the child not only to create an inner
representation of the invisible and inaudible physical reality around her but also
to find herself six months later she started to use the first person i 
helen s story reminds me of the abused recalcitrant uncommunicative kids
we see in our residential treatment programs before she acquired language she
was bewildered and self centered looking back she called that creature
 phantom and indeed our kids come across as phantoms until they can
discover who they are and feel safe enough to communicate what is going on
with them 
in a later book 
the world i live in
 keller again described her birth into
selfhood before my teacher came to me i did not know that i am i lived in a
world that was a no world i had neither will nor intellect i can
remember all this not because i knew that it was so but because i have tactual
memory it enables me to remember that i never contracted my forehead in the
act of thinking 
9
helen s tactual memories memories based only on touch could not be
shared but language opened up the possibility of joining a community at age
eight when helen went with anne to the perkins institution for the blind in
boston where sullivan herself had trained she became able to communicate
with other children for the first time oh what happiness she wrote to talk
freely with other children to feel at home in the great world 
helen s discovery of language with the help of anne sullivan captures the
essence of a therapeutic relationship finding words where words were absent
before and as a result being able to share your deepest pain and deepest feelings
with another human being this is one of most profound experiences we can
have and such resonance in which hitherto unspoken words can be discovered 
uttered and received is fundamental to healing the isolation of trauma 
especially if other people in our lives have ignored or silenced us 
communicating fully is the opposite of being traumatized 
knowing yourself or telling your story our
dual awareness system
anyone who enters talk therapy however almost immediately confronts the

limitations of language this was true of my own psychoanalysis while i talk
easily and can tell interesting tales i quickly realized how difficult it was to feel
my feelings deeply and simultaneously report them to someone else when i got
in touch with the most intimate painful or confusing moments of my life i
often found myself faced with a choice i could either focus on reliving old
scenes in my mind s eye and let myself feel what i had felt back then or i could
tell my analyst logically and coherently what had transpired when i chose the
latter i would quickly lose touch with myself and start to focus on 
his
 opinion of
what i was telling him the slightest hint of doubt or judgment would shut me
down and i would shift my attention to regaining his approval 
since then neuroscience research has shown that we possess two distinct
forms of self awareness one that keeps track of the self across time and one that
registers the self in the present moment the first our autobiographical self 
creates connections among experiences and assembles them into a coherent
story this system is rooted in language our narratives change with the telling 
as our perspective changes and as we incorporate new input
 
the other system moment to moment self awareness is based primarily in
physical sensations but if we feel safe are not rushed we can find words to
communicate that experience as well these two ways of knowing are localized
in different parts of the brain that are largely disconnected from each other 
10
only the system devoted to self awareness which is based in the medial
prefrontal cortex can change the emotional brain 
in the groups i used to lead for veterans i could sometimes see these two
systems working side by side the soldiers told horrible tales of death and
destruction but i noticed that their bodies often simultaneously radiated a sense
of pride and belonging similarly many patients tell me about the happy families
they grew up in while their bodies are slumped over and their voices sound
anxious and uptight one system creates a story for public consumption and if
we tell that story often enough we are likely to start believing that it contains the
whole truth but the other system registers a different truth how we experience
the situation deep inside it is this second system that needs to be accessed 
befriended and reconciled 
just recently at my teaching hospital a group of psychiatric residents and i
interviewed a young woman with temporal lobe epilepsy who was being
evaluated following a suicide attempt the residents asked her standard
questions about her symptoms the medications she was taking how old she was
when the diagnosis was made what had made her try to kill herself she

responded in a flat matter of fact voice she d been five when she was
diagnosed she d lost her job she knew she d been faking it she felt worthless 
for some reason one of the residents asked whether she had been sexually
abused that question surprised me she had given us no indication that she had
had problems with intimacy or sexuality and i wondered if the doctor was
pursuing a private agenda 
yet the story our patient told did not explain why she had fallen apart after
losing her job so i asked her what it had been like for that five year old girl to
be told that something was wrong with her brain that forced her to check in
with herself as she had no ready made script for that question in a subdued tone
of voice she told us that the worst part of her diagnosis was that afterward her
father wanted nothing more to do with her he just saw me as a defective
child nobody had supported her she said so she basically had to manage by
herself 
i then asked her how she felt now about that little girl with newly diagnosed
epilepsy who was left on her own instead of crying for her loneliness or being
angry about the lack of support she said fiercely she was stupid whiny and
dependent she should have stepped up to the plate and sucked it up that
passion obviously came from the part of her that had valiantly tried to cope with
her distress and i acknowledged that it probably had helped her survive back
then i asked her to allow that frightened abandoned girl to tell her what it had
been like to be all alone her illness compounded by family rejection she started
to sob and kept quiet for a long time until finally she said 
 
no she did not
deserve that she should have been supported somebody should have looked
after her then she shifted again and proudly told me about her
accomplishments how much she d achieved despite that lack of support public
story and inner experience finally met 
the body is the bridge
trauma stories lessen the isolation of trauma and they provide an 
explanation
for why people suffer the way they do they allow doctors to make diagnoses so
that they can address problems like insomnia rage nightmares or numbing 
stories can also provide people with a target to blame blaming is a universal
human trait that helps people feel good while feeling bad or as my old teacher
elvin semrad used to say hate makes the world go round but stories also
obscure a more important issue namely that trauma radically changes people 

that in fact they no longer are themselves 
it is excruciatingly difficult to put that feeling of no longer being yourself
into words language evolved primarily to share things out there not to
communicate our inner feelings our interiority again the language center of
the brain is about as far removed from the center for experiencing one s self as is
geographically possible most of us are better at describing someone else than
we are at describing ourselves as i once heard harvard psychologist jerome
kagan say the task of describing most private experiences can be likened to
reaching down to a deep well to pick up small fragile crystal figures while you
are wearing thick leather mittens 
11
we can get past the slipperiness of words by engaging the self observing 
body based self system which speaks through sensations tone of voice and
body tensions being able to perceive visceral sensations is the very foundation
of emotional awareness 
12
 if a patient tells me that he was eight when his father
deserted the family i am likely to stop and ask him to check in with himself 
what happens inside when he tells me about that boy who never saw his father
again where is it registered in his body when you activate your gut feelings
and listen to your heartbreak when you follow the interoceptive pathways to
your innermost recesses things begin to change 
writing to yourself
there are other ways to access your inner world of feelings one of the most
effective is through writing most of us have poured out our hearts in angry 
accusatory plaintive or sad letters after people have betrayed or abandoned us 
doing so almost always makes us feel better even if we never send them when
you write to yourself you don t have to worry about other people s judgment 
you just listen to your own thoughts and let their flow take over later when you
reread what you wrote you often discover surprising truths 
as functioning members of society we re supposed to be cool in our day 
to day interactions and subordinate our feelings to the task at hand when we
talk with someone with whom we don t feel completely safe our social editor
jumps in on full alert and our guard is up writing is different if you ask your
editor to leave you alone for a while things will come out that you had no idea
were there you are free to go into a sort of a trance state in which your pen or
keyboard seems to channel whatever bubbles up from inside you can connect

those self observing and narrative parts of your brain without worrying about the
reception you ll get 
in the practice called free writing you can use any object as your own
personal rorschach test for entering a stream of associations simply write the
first thing that comes to your mind as you look at the object in front of you and
then keep going without stopping rereading or crossing out a wooden spoon
on the counter may trigger memories of making tomato sauce with your
grandmother or of being beaten as a child the teapot that s been passed down
for generations may take you meandering to the furthest reaches of your mind to
the loved ones you ve lost or family holidays that were a mix of love and
conflict soon an image will emerge then a memory and then a paragraph to
record it whatever shows up on the paper will be a manifestation of associations
that are uniquely yours 
my patients often bring in fragments of writing and drawings about
memories that they may not yet be ready to discuss reading the content out
loud would probably overwhelm them but they want me to be aware of what
they are wrestling with i tell them how much i appreciate their courage in
allowing themselves to explore hitherto hidden parts of themselves and in
entrusting me with them these tentative communications guide my treatment
plan for example by helping me to decide whether to add somatic processing 
neurofeedback or emdr to our current work 
as far as i m aware the first systematic test of the power of language to
relieve trauma was done in 1986 when james pennebaker at the university of
texas in austin turned his introductory psychology class into an experimental
laboratory pennebaker started off with a healthy respect for the importance of
inhibition of keeping things to yourself which he viewed as the glue of
civilization 
13
 but he also assumed that people pay a price for trying to suppress
being aware of the elephant in the room 
he began by asking each student to identify a deeply personal experience
that they d found very stressful or traumatic he then divided the class into three
groups one would write about what was currently going on in their lives the
second would write about the details of the traumatic or stressful event and the
third would recount the facts of the experience their feelings and emotions about
it and what impact they thought this event had had on their lives all of the
students wrote continuously for fifteen minutes on four consecutive days while
sitting alone in a small cubicle in the psychology building 
the students took the study very seriously many revealed secrets that they

had never told anyone they often cried as they wrote and many confided in the
course assistants that they d become preoccupied with these experiences of the
two hundred participants sixty five wrote about a childhood trauma although
the death of a family member was the most frequent topic
 
 22 percent of the
women and 10 percent of the men reported sexual trauma prior to the age of
seventeen 
the researchers asked the students about their health and were surprised
how often the students spontaneously reported histories of major and minor
health problems cancer high blood pressure ulcers flu headaches and
earaches 
14
 those who reported a traumatic sexual experience in childhood had
been hospitalized an average of 1 7 days in the previous year almost twice the
rate of the others 
the team then compared the number of visits to the student health center
participants had made during the month prior to the study to the number in the
month following it the group that had written about both the facts and the
emotions related to their trauma clearly benefited the most they had a 50
percent drop in doctor visits compared with the other two groups writing about
their deepest thoughts and feelings about traumas had improved their mood and
resulted in a more optimistic attitude and better physical health 
when the students themselves were asked to assess the study they focused
on how it had increased their self understanding it helped me think about what
i felt during those times i never realized how it affected me before i had to
think and resolve past experiences one result of the experiment was peace of
mind to have to write about emotions and feelings helped me understand how i
felt and why 
15
in a subsequent study pennebaker asked half of a group of seventy two
students to talk into a tape recorder about the most traumatic experience of their
lives the other half discussed their plans for the rest of the day as they spoke 
researchers monitored their physiological reactions blood pleasure heart rate 
muscle tension and hand temperature 
16
 this study had similar results those
who allowed themselves to feel their emotions showed significant physiological
changes both immediate and long term during their confessions blood pressure 
heart rate and other autonomic functions increased but afterward their arousal
fell to levels below where they had been at the start of the study the drop in
blood pressure could still be measured six weeks after the experiment ended 
it is now widely accepted that stressful experiences whether divorce or
final exams or loneliness have a negative effect on immune function but this

was a highly controversial notion at the time of pennebaker s study building on
his protocols a team of researchers at the ohio state university college of
medicine compared two groups of students who wrote either about a personal
trauma or about a superficial topic 
17
 again those who wrote about personal
traumas had fewer visits to the student health center and their improved health
correlated with improved immune function as measured by the action of t
lymphocytes natural killer cells and other immune markers in the blood this
effect was most obvious directly after the experiment but it could still be the
detected six weeks later writing experiments from around the world with grade
school students nursing home residents medical students maximum security
prisoners arthritis sufferers new mothers and rape victims consistently show
that writing about upsetting events improves physical and mental health 
another aspect of pennebaker s studies caught my attention when his
subjects talked about intimate or difficult issues they often changed their tone of
voice and speaking style the differences were so striking that pennebaker
wondered if he had mixed up his tapes for example one woman described her
plans for the day in a childlike high pitched voice but a few minutes later when
she described stealing one hundred dollars from an open cash register both the
volume and pitch of her voice became so much lower that she sounded like an
entirely different person alterations in emotional states were also reflected in
the subjects handwriting as participants changed topics they might move from
cursive to block letters and back to cursive there were also variations in the slant
of the letters and in the pressure of their pens 

such changes are called switching in clinical practice and we see them
often in individuals with trauma histories patients activate distinctly different
emotional and physiological states as they move from one topic to another 
switching manifests not only as remarkably different vocal patterns but also in
different facial expressions and body movements some patients even appear to
change their personal identity from timid to forceful and aggressive or from
anxiously compliant to starkly seductive when they write about their deepest
fears their handwriting often becomes more childlike and primitive 

if patients who present in such dramatically different states are treated as
fakes or if they are told to stop showing their unpredictably annoying parts they
are likely to become mute they probably will continue to seek help but after
they have been silenced they will transmit their cries for help not by talking but
by acting with suicide attempts depression and rage attacks as we will see in
chapter 17 they will improve only if both patient and therapist appreciate the
roles that these different states have played in their survival 
art music and dance
there are thousands of art music and dance therapists who do beautiful work
with abused children soldiers suffering from ptsd incest victims refugees 
and torture survivors and numerous accounts attest to the effectiveness of
expressive therapies 
18
 however at this point we know very little about how
they work or about the specific aspects of traumatic stress they address and it
would present an enormous logistical and financial challenge to do the research
necessary to establish their value scientifically 
the capacity of art music and dance to circumvent the speechlessness that
comes with terror may be one reason they are used as trauma treatments in

cultures around the world one of the few systematic studies to compare
nonverbal artistic expression with writing was done by james pennebaker and
anne krantz a san francisco dance and movement therapist 
19
 one third of a
group of sixty four students was asked to disclose a personal traumatic
experience through expressive body movements for at least ten minutes a day for
three consecutive days and then to write about it for another ten minutes a
second group danced but did not write about their trauma and a third group
engaged in a routine exercise program over the three following months
members of all groups reported that they felt happier and healthier however 
only the expressive movement group that also wrote showed objective evidence 
better physical health and an improved grade point average the study did not
evaluate specific ptsd symptoms pennebaker and krantz concluded the
mere expression of the trauma is not sufficient health does appear to require
translating experiences into language 
however we still do not know whether this conclusion that language is
essential to healing is in fact always true writing studies that have focused
on ptsd symptoms as opposed to general health have been disappointing 
when i discussed this with pennebaker he cautioned me that most writing
studies of ptsd patients have been done in group settings where participants
were expected to share their stories he reiterated the point i ve made above
 
that the object of writing is to write to yourself to let your self know what you
have been trying to avoid 
the limits of language
trauma overwhelms listeners as well as speakers in 
the great war in modern
memory 
his masterful study of world war i paul fussell comments brilliantly
on the zone of silence that trauma creates 
one of the cruxes of war is the collision between events and the
language available or thought appropriate to describe them 
logically there is no reason why the english language could not
perfectly well render the actuality of warfare it is rich in terms like
blood
 
terror
 
agony
 
madness
 
shit
 
cruelty
 
murder
 
sell out
 
pain
 and
hoax
 as well as phrases like 
legs blown off
 
intestines gushing out over
his hands
 
screaming all night
 
bleeding to death from the rectum
 and

the like the problem was less one of language than of gentility
and optimism the real reason that soldiers fall silent is that
soldiers have discovered that no one is very interested in the bad news
they have to report what listener wants to be torn and shaken when he
doesn t have to be we have made 
unspeakable
 mean indescribable it
really means 
nasty
 
20
talking about painful events doesn t necessarily establish community 
often quite the contrary families and organizations may reject members who air
the dirty laundry friends and family can lose patience with people who get stuck
in their grief or hurt this is one reason why trauma victims often withdraw and
why their stories become rote narratives edited into a form least likely to
provoke rejection 
it is an enormous challenge to find safe places to express the pain of trauma 
which is why survivor groups like alcoholics anonymous adult children of
alcoholics narcotics anonymous and other support groups can be so critical 
finding a responsive community in which to tell your truth makes recovery
possible that is also why survivors need professional therapists who are trained
to listen to the agonizing details of their lives i recall the first time a veteran told
me about killing a child in vietnam i had a vivid flashback to when i was about
seven years old and my father told me that a child next door had been beaten to
death by nazi soldiers in front of our house for showing a lack of respect my
reaction to the veteran s confession was too much to bear and i had to end the
session that is why therapists need to have done their own intensive therapy so
they can take care of themselves and remain emotionally available to their
patients even when their patients stories arouse feelings of rage or revulsion 
a different problem arises when trauma victims themselves become literally
speechless when the language area of the brain shuts down 
21
 i have seen this
shutdown in the courtroom in many immigration cases and also in a case brought
against a perpetrator of mass slaughter in rwanda when asked to testify about
their experiences victims often become so overwhelmed that they are barely
able to speak or are hijacked into such panic that they can t clearly articulate
what happened to them their testimony is often dismissed as being too chaotic 
confused and fragmented to be credible 
others try to recount their history in a way that keeps them from being
triggered this can make them come across as evasive and unreliable witnesses 
i have seen dozens of legal cases dismissed because asylum seekers were unable

to give coherent accounts of their reasons for fleeing i ve also known numerous
veterans whose claims were denied by the veterans administration because they
could not tell precisely what had happened to them 
confusion and mutism are routine in therapy offices we fully expect that
our patients will become overwhelmed if we keep pressing them for the details
of their story for that reason we ve learned to pendulate our approach to
trauma to use a term coined by my friend peter levine we don t avoid
confronting the details but we teach our patients how to safely dip one toe in the
water and then take it out again thus approaching the truth gradually 
we start by establishing inner islands of safety within the body 
22
 this
means helping patients identify parts of the body postures or movements where
they can ground themselves whenever they feel stuck terrified or enraged 
these parts usually lie outside the reach of the vagus nerve which carries the
messages of panic to the chest abdomen and throat and they can serve as allies
in integrating the trauma i might ask a patient if her hands feel okay and if she
says yes i ll ask her to move them exploring their lightness and warmth and
flexibility later if i see her chest tighten and her breath almost disappear i can
stop her and ask her to focus on her hands and move them so that she can feel
herself as separate from the trauma or i might ask her to focus on her out breath
and notice how she can change it or ask her to lift her arms up and down with
each breath a qigong movement 
for some patients tapping acupressure points is a good anchor 
23
 i ask others
to feel the weight of their body in the chair or to plant their feet on the floor i
might ask a patient who is collapsing into silence to see what happens when he
sits up straight some patients discover their own islands of safety they begin
to get that they can create body sensations to counterbalance feeling out of
control this sets the stage for trauma resolution pendulating between states of
exploration and safety between language and body between remembering the
past and feeling alive in the present 
dealing with reality
dealing with traumatic memories is however just the beginning of treatment 
numerous studies have found that people with ptsd have more general
problems with focused attention and with learning new information 
24
 alexander
mcfarlane did a simple test he asked a group of people to name as many words

beginning with the letter 
b
 as they could in one minute normal subjects
averaged fifteen words those with ptsd averaged three or four normal
subjects hesitated when they saw threatening words like blood wound or
 rape mcfarlane s ptsd subjects reacted just as hesitantly to ordinary words
like wool ice cream and bicycle 
25
after a while most people with ptsd don t spend a great deal of time or
effort on dealing with the past their problem is simply making it through the
day even traumatized patients who are making real contributions in teaching 
business medicine or the arts and who are successfully raising their children
expend a lot more energy on the everyday tasks of living than do ordinary
mortals 
yet another pitfall of language is the illusion that our thinking can easily be
corrected if it doesn t make sense the cognitive part of cognitive
behavioral therapy focuses on changing such dysfunctional thinking this is a
top down approach to change in which the therapist challenges or reframes 
negative cognitions as in 
 
let s compare your feelings that you are to blame for
your rape with the actual facts of the matter or let s compare your terror of
driving with the statistics about road safety today 
i m reminded of the distraught woman who once came to our clinic asking
for help with her two month old because the baby was so selfish would she
have benefited from a fact sheet on child development or an explanation of the
concept of altruism such information would be unlikely to help her until she
gained access to the frightened abandoned parts of herself the parts expressed
by her terror of dependence 
there is no question traumatized people have irrational thoughts i was to
blame for being so sexy the other guys weren t afraid they re real men i
should have known better than to walk down that street it s best to treat those
thoughts as cognitive flashbacks you don t argue with them any more than you
would argue with someone who keeps having visual flashbacks of a terrible
accident they are residues of traumatic incidents thoughts they were thinking
when or shortly after the traumas occurred that are reactivated under stressful
conditions a better way to treat them is with emdr the subject of the
following chapter 
becoming some body

the reason people become overwhelmed by telling their stories and the reason
they have cognitive flashbacks is that their brains have changed as freud and
breuer observed trauma does not simply act as a releasing agent for symptoms 
rather the psychical trauma or more precisely the memory of the trauma 
acts like a foreign body which long after its entry must continue to be regarded
as an agent that still is at work 
26
 like a splinter that causes an infection it is
the body s response to the foreign object that becomes the problem more than
the object itself 
modern neuroscience solidly supports freud s notion that many of our
conscious thoughts are complex rationalizations for the flood of instincts 
reflexes motives and deep seated memories that emanate from the unconscious 
as we have seen trauma interferes with the proper functioning of brain areas
that manage and interpret experience
 
a robust sense of self one that allows a
person to state confidently this is what i think and feel and this is what is
going on with me depends on a healthy and dynamic interplay among these
areas 
almost every brain imaging study of trauma patients finds abnormal
activation of the insula this part of the brain integrates and interprets the input
from the internal organs including our muscles joints and balance
 proprioceptive system to generate the sense of being embodied the insula
can transmit signals to the amygdala that trigger fight fight responses this does
not require any cognitive input or any conscious recognition that something has
gone awry you just feel on edge and unable to focus or at worst have a sense
of imminent doom these powerful feelings are generated deep inside the brain
and cannot be eliminated by reason or understanding 
being constantly assaulted by but consciously cut off from the origin of
bodily sensations produces alexithymia not being able to sense and
communicate what is going on with you only by getting in touch with your
body by connecting viscerally with your self can you regain a sense of who you
are your priorities and values alexithymia dissociation and shutdown all
involve the brain structures that enable us to focus know what we feel and take
action to protect ourselves when these essential structures are subjected to
inescapable shock the result may be confusion and agitation or it may be
emotional detachment often accompanied by out of body experiences the
feeling you re watching yourself from far away in other words trauma makes
people feel like either
 some body else
 or like 
no body
 in order to overcome
trauma you need help to get back in touch with 
your body
 with 
your self
 

there is no question that language is essential our sense of self depends on
being able to organize our memories into a coherent whole 
27
 this requires well 
functioning connections between the conscious brain and the self system of the
body connections that often are damaged by trauma the full story can be told
only after those structures are repaired and after the groundwork has been laid 
after no body becomes some body

chapter 15
letting go of the past emdr
was it a vision or a waking dream 
fled is that music do i wake or sleep 
 john keats
avid a middle aged contractor came to see me because his violent rage
attacks were making his home a living hell during our first session he told
me a story about something that had happened to him the summer he was
twenty three he was working as a lifeguard and one afternoon a group of kids
were roughhousing in the pool and drinking beer david told them alcohol was
not allowed in response the boys attacked him and one of them took out his left
eye with a broken beer bottle thirty years later he still had nightmares and
flashbacks about the stabbing 
he was merciless in his criticisms of his own teenage son and often yelled at
him for the slightest infraction and he simply could not bring himself to show
any affection toward his wife on some level he felt that the tragic loss of his eye
gave him permission to abuse other people but he also hated the angry vengeful
person he had become he had noticed that his efforts to manage his rage made
him chronically tense and he wondered if his fear of losing control had made
love and friendship impossible 
during his second visit i introduced a procedure called eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing emdr i asked david to go back to the
details of his assault and bring to mind his images of the attack the sounds he
had heard and the thoughts that had gone through his mind just let those

moments come back i told him 
i then asked him to follow my index finger as i moved it slowly back and
forth about twelve inches from his right eye within seconds a cascade of rage
and terror came to the surface accompanied by vivid sensations of pain blood
running down his cheek and the realization that he couldn t see as he reported
these sensations i made an occasional encouraging sound and kept moving my
finger back and forth every few minutes i stopped and asked him to take a deep
breath then i asked him to pay attention to what was now on his mind which
was a fight he had had in school i told him to notice that and to stay with that
memory other memories emerged seemingly at random looking for his
assailants everywhere wanting to hurt them getting into barroom brawls each
time he reported a new memory or sensation i urged him to notice what was
coming to mind and resumed the finger movements 
at the end of that visit he looked calmer and visibly relieved he told me
that the memory of the stabbing had lost its intensity it was now something
unpleasant that had happened a long time ago it really sucked he said
thoughtfully and it kept me off kilter for years but i m surprised what a good
life i eventually was able to carve out for myself 
our third session the following week dealt with the aftermath of the
trauma how he had used drugs and alcohol for years to cope with his rage as
we repeated the emdr sequences still more memories arose david
remembered talking with a prison guard he knew about having his incarcerated
assailant killed and then changing his mind recalling this decision was
profoundly liberating he had come to see himself as a monster who was barely
in control but realizing that he d turned away from revenge put him back in
touch with a mindful generous side of himself 
next he spontaneously realized he was treating his son the way he had felt
toward his teenaged attackers as our session ended he asked if i could meet
with him and his family so he could tell his son what had happened and ask for
his forgiveness at our fifth and final session he reported that he was sleeping
better and said that for the first time in his life he felt a sense of inner peace a
year later he called to report not only that his he and wife had grown closer and
had started to practice yoga together but also that he laughed more and took real
pleasure in his gardening and woodworking 
learning about emdr

my experience with david is one of many i have had over the past two decades
in which emdr helped to make painful re creations of the trauma a thing of the
past my introduction to this method came through maggie a spunky young
psychologist who ran a halfway house for sexually abused girls maggie got into
one confrontation after another clashing with nearly everybody except the
thirteen and fourteen year old girls she cared for she did drugs had dangerous
and often violent boyfriends had frequent altercations with her bosses and
moved from place to place because she could not tolerate her roommates nor
they her i never understood how she had mobilized enough stability and
concentration to earn a phd in psychology from a reputable graduate school 
maggie had been referred to a therapy group i was running for women with
similar problems during her second meeting she told us that her father had
raped her twice once when she was five years old and once when she was seven 
she was convinced it had been her fault she loved her daddy she explained and
she must have been so seductive that he could not control himself listening to
her i thought she might not blame her father but she sure is blaming just about
everybody else including her previous therapists for not helping her get better 
like many trauma survivors she told one story with words and another in her
actions in which she kept replaying various aspects of her trauma 
then one day maggie came to the group eager to discuss a remarkable
experience she d had the previous weekend at an emdr training for
professionals at that time i d heard only that emdr was a new fad in which
therapists wiggled their fingers in front of patients eyes to me and my
academic colleagues it sounded like yet another of the crazes that have always
plagued psychiatry and i was convinced that this would turn out to be another of
maggie s misadventures 
maggie told us that during her emdr session she had vividly remembered
her father s rape when she was seven remembered it from inside her child s
body she could feel physically how small she was she could feel her father s
huge body on top of her and could smell the alcohol on his breath and yet she
told us even as she relived the incident she was able to observe it from the point
of view of her twenty nine year old self she burst into tears i was such a little
girl how could a huge man do this to a little girl she cried for a while and
then said it s over now i now know what happened it wasn t my fault i was a
little girl and there was nothing i could do to keep him from molesting me 
i was astounded i had been looking for a long time for a way to help people
revisit their traumatic past without becoming retraumatized it seemed that

maggie had had an experience as lifelike as a flashback and yet had not been
hijacked by it could emdr make it safe for people to access the imprints of
trauma could it then transform them into memories of events that had happened
far in the past 
maggie had a few more emdr sessions and remained in our group long
enough for us to see how she changed she was much less angry but she kept
that sardonic sense of humor that i enjoyed so much a few months later she got
involved with a very different kind of man than she d ever been attracted to
before she left the group announcing that she d resolved her trauma and i
decided it was time for me to get trained in emdr 
emdr first exposures
like many scientific advances emdr originated with a chance observation 
one day in 1987 psychologist francine shapiro was walking through a park 
preoccupied with some painful memories when she noticed that rapid eye
movements produced a dramatic relief from her distress how could a major
treatment modality grow from such a brief experience how is it possible that
such a simple process had not been noted before initially skeptical about her
observation she subjected her method to years of experimentation and research 
gradually building it into a standardized procedure that could be taught and
tested in controlled studies 
1
i arrived for my first emdr training in need of some trauma processing
myself a few weeks earlier the jesuit priest who was chair of my department at
massachusetts general hospital had suddenly shut down the trauma clinic 
leaving us scrambling for a new site and new funds to treat our patients train our
students and conduct our research at around the same time my friend frank
putnam who was doing the long term study of sexually abused girls that i
discussed in chapter 10 was fired from the national institutes of health and
rick kluft the country s foremost expert on dissociation lost his unit at the
institute of the pennsylvania hospital it might have all been a coincidence but
it felt as if my whole world was under attack 
my distress about the trauma clinic seemed like a good test for my emdr
trial while i was following my partner s fingers with my eyes a rapid
succession of fuzzy childhood scenes came to mind intense family dinner table
conversations confrontations with schoolmates during recess throwing pebbles

at a shed window with my older brother all of them the sort of vivid floating 
 hypnopompic images we experience when we slumber late on a sunday
morning then forget the moment we fully awaken 
after about half an hour my fellow trainee and i revisited the scene in which
my boss told me that he was closing my clinic now i felt resigned okay it
happened and now it s time to move on i never looked back the clinic later
reconstituted itself and has thrived ever since was emdr the sole reason i was
able to let go of my anger and distress of course i ll never know for certain but
my mental journey through unrelated childhood scenes to putting the episode
to rest was unlike anything i had experienced in talk therapy 
what happened next when it was my turn to administer emdr was even
more intriguing we rotated to a different group and my new fellow student 
whom i d never met before told me he wanted to address some painful
childhood incidents involving his father but he did not want to discuss them i
had never worked on anybody s trauma without knowing the story and i was
annoyed and flustered by his refusal to share any details while i was moving
my fingers in front of his eyes he looked intensely distressed he began
sobbing and his breathing became rapid and shallow but each time i asked him
the questions that the protocol called for he refused to tell me what came to his
mind 
at the end of our forty five minute session the first thing my colleague said
was that he d found dealing with me so unpleasant that he would never refer a
patient to me otherwise he remarked the emdr session had resolved the
matter of his father s abuse
 
while i was skeptical and suspected that his
rudeness toward me was a carryover from unresolved feelings toward his father 
there was no question that he appeared much more relaxed 
i turned to my emdr trainer gerald puk and told him how flummoxed i
was this man clearly did not like me and had looked profoundly distressed
during the emdr session but now he was telling me that his long standing
misery was gone how could i possibly know what he had or had not resolved if
he was unwilling to tell me what had happened during the session 
gerry smiled and asked if by chance i had become a mental health
professional in order to solve some of my own personal issues i confirmed that
most people who knew me thought that might be the case then he asked if i
found it meaningful when people told me their trauma stories again i had to
agree with him then he said you know bessel maybe you need to learn to
put your voyeuristic tendencies on hold if it s important for you to hear trauma

stories why don t you go to a bar put a couple of dollars on the table and say to
your neighbor i ll buy you a drink if you tell me your trauma story but you
really need to know the difference between your desire to hear stories and your
patient s internal process of healing i took gerry s admonition to heart and
ever since have enjoyed repeating it to my students 
i left my emdr training preoccupied with three issues that fascinate me to
this day 
emdr loosens up something in the mind brain that gives people
rapid access to loosely associated memories and images from their
past this seems to help them put the traumatic experience into a
larger context or perspective 
people may be able to heal from trauma without talking about it 
emdr enables them to observe their experiences in a new way 
without verbal give and take with another person 
emdr can help even if the patient and the therapist do not have a
trusting relationship this was particularly intriguing because trauma 
understandably rarely leaves people with an open trusting heart 
in the years since i have done emdr with patients who spoke swahili 
mandarin and breton all languages in which i can say only notice that the
key emdr instruction i always had a translator available but primarily to
explain the steps of the process because emdr doesn t require patients to
speak about the intolerable or explain to a therapist why they feel so upset it
allows them to stay fully focused on their internal experience with sometimes
extraordinary results 
studying emdr
the trauma clinic was saved by a manager at the massachusetts department of
mental health who had followed our work with children and now asked us to
take on the task of organizing the community trauma response team for the
boston area that was enough to cover our basic operations and the rest was
supplied by an energetic staff who loved what we were doing including the
newly discovered power of emdr to cure some of the patients whom we d been
unable to help before 
my colleagues and i began to show one another videotapes of our emdr

sessions with ptsd patients which enabled us to observe dramatic week by 
week improvements we then started to formally measure their progress on a
standard ptsd rating scale we also arranged with elizabeth matthew a young
neuroimaging specialist at the new england deaconess hospital to have twelve
patients brains scanned before and after their treatment after only three emdr
sessions eight of the twelve had shown a significant decrease in their ptsd
scores on their scans we could see a sharp increase in prefrontal lobe activation
after treatment as well as much more activity in the anterior cingulate and the
basal ganglia this shift could account for the difference in how they now
experienced their trauma 
one man reported i remember it as though it was a real memory but it was
more distant typically i drowned in it but this time i was floating on top i had
the feeling that i was in control a woman told us before i felt each and
every step of it now it is like a whole instead of fragments so it is more
manageable the trauma had lost its immediacy and become a story about
something that happened a long time ago 
we subsequently secured funding from the national institutes of mental
health to compare the effects of emdr with standard doses of prozac or a
placebo 
2
 of our eighty eight subjects thirty received emdr twenty eight
prozac and the rest the sugar pill as often happens the people on placebo did
well after eight weeks their 42 percent improvement was greater than that for
many other treatments that are promoted as evidence based 
the group on prozac did slightly better than the placebo group but barely
so this is typical of most studies of drugs for ptsd simply showing up brings
about a 30 percent to 42 percent improvement when drugs work they add an
additional 5 percent to 15 percent however the patients on emdr did
substantially better than those on either prozac or the placebo after eight
emdr sessions one in four were completely cured their ptsd scores had
dropped to negligible levels compared with one in ten of the prozac group but
the real difference occurred over time when we interviewed our subjects eight
months later 60 percent of those who had received emdr scored as being
completely cured as the great psychiatrist milton erickson said once you kick
the log the river will start flowing once people started to integrate their
traumatic memories they spontaneously continued to improve in contrast all
those who had taken prozac relapsed when they went off the drug 
this study was significant because it demonstrated that a focused trauma 
specific therapy for ptsd like emdr could be much more effective than

medication other studies have confirmed that if patients take prozac or related
drugs like celexa paxil and zoloft their ptsd symptoms often improve but
only as long as they keep taking them this makes drug treatment much more
expensive in the long run interestingly despite prozac s status as a major
antidepressant in our study emdr also produced a greater reduction in
depression scores than taking the antidepressant 
another key finding of our study adults with histories of childhood trauma
responded very differently to emdr from those who were traumatized as adults 
at the end of eight weeks almost half of the adult onset group that received
emdr scored as completely cured while only 9 percent of the child abuse
group showed such pronounced improvement eight months later the cure rate
was 73 percent for the adult onset group compared with 25 percent for those
with histories of child abuse the child abuse group had small but consistently
positive responses to prozac 
these results reinforce the findings that i reported in chapter 9 chronic
childhood abuse causes very different mental and biological adaptations than
discrete traumatic events in adulthood emdr is a powerful treatment for stuck
traumatic memories but it doesn t necessarily resolve the effects of the betrayal
and abandonment that accompany physical or sexual abuse in childhood eight
weeks of therapy of any kind is rarely sufficient to resolve the legacy of long 
standing trauma 
as of 2014 our emdr study had the most positive outcome of any
published study of people who developed their ptsd in reaction to a traumatic
event as an adult but despite these results and those of dozens of other studies 
many of my colleagues continue to be skeptical about emdr
 
perhaps because
it seems too good to be true too simple to be so powerful i surely can
understand that sort of skepticism emdr is an unusual procedure 
interestingly in the first solid scientific study using emdr in combat veterans
with ptsd emdr was expected to do so poorly that it was included as the
control condition for comparison with biofeedback assisted relaxation therapy 
to the researchers surprise twelve sessions of emdr turned out to be the more
effective treatment 
3
 emdr has since become one of the treatments for ptsd
sanctioned by the department of veterans affairs 
is emdr a form of exposure therapy 

some psychologists have hypothesized that emdr actually desensitizes people
to the traumatic material and thus is related to exposure therapy a more accurate
description would be that it 
integrates
 the traumatic material as our research
showed after emdr people thought of the trauma as a coherent event in the
past instead of experiencing sensations and images divorced from any context 
memories evolve and change immediately after a memory is laid down it
undergoes a lengthy process of integration and reinterpretation a process that
automatically happens in the mind brain without any input from the conscious
self when the process is complete the experience is integrated with other life
events and stops having a life of its own 
4
 as we have seen in ptsd this
process fails and the memory remains stuck undigested and raw 
unfortunately few psychologists are taught during their training how the
memory processing system in the brain works this omission can lead to
misguided approaches to treatment in contrast to phobias such as a spider
phobia which is based on a specific irrational fear posttraumatic stress is the
result of a fundamental reorganization of the central nervous system based on
having experienced an actual threat of annihilation or seeing someone else
being annihilated which reorganizes self experience as helpless and the
interpretation of reality the entire world is a dangerous place 
during exposure patients initially become extremely upset as they revisit
the traumatic experience they show sharp increases in their heart rate blood
pressure and stress hormones but if they manage to stay with the treatment and
keep reliving their trauma they slowly become less reactive and less prone to
disintegrate when they recall the event as a result they get lower scores on their
ptsd ratings however as far as we know simply exposing someone to the old
trauma does not integrate the memory into the overall context of their lives and
it rarely restores them to the level of joyful engagement with people and pursuits
they had prior to the trauma 
in contrast emdr as well as the treatments discussed in subsequent
chapters internal family systems yoga neurofeedback psychomotor therapy 
and theater focus not only on regulating the intense memories activated by
trauma but also on restoring a sense of agency engagement and commitment
through ownership of body and mind 
processing trauma with emdr

kathy was a twenty one year old student at a local university when i first met
her she looked terrified she had been in psychotherapy for three years with a
therapist whom she trusted and felt understood by but with whom she was not
making any progress after her third suicide attempt her university health service
referred her to me hoping that the new technique i d told them about could help
her 
like several of my other traumatized patients kathy was able to become
completely absorbed in her studies when she read a book or wrote a research
paper she could block out everything else about her life this enabled her to be a
competent student even when she had no idea how to establish a loving
relationship with herself let alone with an intimate partner 
kathy told me that her father had used her for many years for child
prostitution which would normally have made me think of using emdr only as
an adjunctive therapy however she turned out to be an emdr virtuoso and
recovered completely after eight sessions the shortest time thus far in my
experience for someone with a history of severe childhood abuse those sessions
took place fifteen years ago and i recently met with her to discuss the pros and
cons of her adopting a third child she was a delight smart funny and joyfully
engaged with her family and her work as an assistant professor of child
development 
i d like to share my notes on kathy s fourth emdr treatment not only to
demonstrate what typically happens in such a session but also to reveal the
human mind in action as it integrates a traumatic experience no brain scan 
blood test or rating scale can measure this and even a video recording can
convey only a shadow of how emdr can unleash the imaginative powers of the
mind 
kathy sat with her chair at a forty five degree angle to mine so that we
were about four feet apart i asked her to bring a particularly painful memory to
mind and encouraged her to recall what she had heard saw thought and felt in
her body as it took place my records do not show whether she told me what the
particular memory was my guess is probably not since i did not write it down 
i asked her whether she was now in the memory and when she said yes i
asked her how real it felt on a scale of one to ten about a nine she said then i
asked her to follow my moving finger with her eyes from time to time after
completing a set of about twenty five eye movements i might say take a deep
breath followed by what do you get now or what comes to mind now 
kathy would then tell me what she was thinking whenever her tone of voice 

facial expression body movements or breathing patterns indicated that this was
an emotionally significant theme i would say notice that and start another
set of eye movements during which she did not speak other than uttering those
few words i remained silent for the next forty five minutes 
here is the association kathy reported after the first eye movement
sequence i realize that i have scars from when he tied my hands behind my
back the other scar is when he marked me to claim me as his and there she
points are bite marks she looked stunned but surprisingly calm as she
recalled i remember being doused in gasoline he took polaroid pictures of me
 and then i was submerged in water i was gang raped by my father and two of
his friends i was tied to a table i remember them raping me with budweiser
bottles 
my stomach was clenching but i didn t comment beyond asking kathy to
keep those memories in mind after about thirty more back and forth
movements i stopped when i saw that she was smiling when i asked what she
was thinking she said i was in a karate class it was great i really kicked butt 
i saw them backing off i yelled don t you see you are hurting me i am not
your girlfriend i said stay there and began the next sequence when it
ended kathy said i have an image of two me s this smart pretty little girl 
and that little slut all these women who could not take care of themselves or me
or their men leaving it up to me to service all these men she started to sob
during the next sequence and when we stopped she said i saw how little i was
 the brutalization of the little girl it was not my fault i nodded and said 
 that s right stay there the next round ended with kathy reporting i m
picturing my life now my big me holding my little me saying you are safe
now i nodded encouragingly and continued 
the images kept coming i have pictures of a bulldozer flattening the house
i grew up in it s over then kathy started on a different track i am thinking
about how much i like jeffrey a boy in one of her classes thinking that he
might not want to hang out with me thinking i can t handle it i have never
been someone s girlfriend before and i don t know how i asked her what she
thought she needed to know and began the next sequence now there is a
person who just wants to be with me it is too simple i don t know how to just
be myself around men i am petrified 
as she tracked my finger kathy started to sob when i stopped she told
me i had an image of jeffrey and me sitting in the coffeehouse my father
comes in the door he starts screaming at the top of his lungs and he is wielding

an ax he says i told you that you belong to me he puts me on top of the table
 
then he rapes me and then he rapes jeffrey she was crying hard now how
can you be open with somebody when you have visions of your dad raping you
and then raping us both i wanted to comfort her but i knew it was more
important to keep her associations moving i asked her to focus on what she felt
in her body i feel it in my forearms in my shoulders and my right chest i just
want to be held we continued the emdr and when we stopped kathy looked
relaxed i heard jeffrey say it s okay that he was sent here to take care of me 
and that it was not anything that i did and that he just wants to be with me for
my sake again i asked what she felt in her body i feel really peaceful a little
bit shaky
 
like when you re using new muscles some relief jeffrey knows all
this already i feel like i m alive and that it is all over but i am afraid that my
father has another little girl and that makes me very very sad i want to save
her 
but as we continued the trauma returned together with other thoughts and
images i need to throw up i have intrusions of lots of smells
 
bad cologne 
alcohol vomit a few minutes later kathy was crying profusely i really feel
my mom here now it feels like she wants me to forgive her i have the sense that
the same thing happened to her
 
she is apologizing to me over and over she s
telling me that this happened to her
 
that it was my grandfather she s also
telling me that my grandmother is really sorry for not being there to protect me 
i kept asking her to take deep breaths and stay with whatever was coming up 
at the end of the next sequence kathy said i feel like it s over i felt my
grandmother holding me at my current age
 
telling me that she is so sorry she
married my grandfather that she and my mom are making sure that it stops
here after one final emdr sequence kathy was smiling i have an image of
pushing my father out of the coffeehouse and jeffrey locking the door behind
him he stands outside you can see him through the glass everybody s making
fun of him 
with the help of emdr kathy was able to integrate the memories of her
trauma and call on her imagination to help her lay them to rest arriving at a
sense of completion and control she did so with minimal input from me and
without any discussion of the particulars of her experiences i never felt a
reason to question their accuracy her experiences were real to her and my job
was to help her deal with them in the present the process freed something in
her mind brain to activate new images feelings and thoughts it was as if her
life force emerged to create new possibilities for her future 
5

as we ve seen traumatic memories persist as split off unmodified images 
sensations and feelings to my mind the most remarkable feature of emdr is
its apparent capacity to activate a series of unsought and seemingly unrelated
sensations emotions images and thoughts in conjunction with the original
memory this way of reassembling old information into new packages may be
just the way we integrate ordinary nontraumatic day to day experiences 
exploring the sleep connection
shortly after learning about emdr i was asked to speak about my work at the
sleep laboratory headed by allan hobson at the massachusetts mental health
center hobson together with his teacher michel jouvet 
6
 was famous for
discovering where dreams are generated in the brain and one of his research
assistants robert stickgold was just then beginning to explore the function of
dreams i showed the group a videotape of a patient who had suffered from
severe ptsd for thirteen years after a terrible car accident and who in only two
sessions of emdr had transformed from a helpless panicked victim into a
confident assertive woman bob was fascinated 
a few weeks later a friend of stickgold s family became so depressed after
the death of her cat that she had to be hospitalized the attending psychiatrist
concluded that the cat s death had triggered unresolved memories of the death of
the woman s mother when she was twelve and he connected her with roger
solomon a well known emdr trainer who treated her successfully afterward
she called stickgold and said bob you have to study this it s really strange
 
it
has to do with your brain not your mind 
soon afterward an article appeared in the journal 
dreaming
 suggesting that
emdr was related to rapid eye movement rem sleep
 
the phase of sleep in
which dreaming occurs 
7
 research had already shown that sleep and dream
sleep in particular plays a major role in mood regulation as the article in
dreaming
 pointed out the eyes move rapidly back and forth in rem sleep just
as they do in emdr increasing our time in rem sleep reduces depression 
while the less rem sleep we get the more likely we are to become depressed 
8
of course ptsd is notoriously associated with disturbed sleep and self 
medication with alcohol or drugs further disrupts rem sleep during my time at
the va my colleagues and i had found that the veterans with ptsd frequently
woke themselves up soon after going into rem sleep
9
 probably because they

had activated a trauma fragment during a dream 
10
 other researchers have also
noticed this phenomenon but thought that it was irrelevant to understanding
ptsd 
11
today we know that both deep sleep and rem sleep play important roles in
how memories change over time the sleeping brain reshapes memory by
increasing the imprint of emotionally relevant information while helping
irrelevant material fade away 
12
 in a series of elegant studies stickgold and his
colleagues showed that the sleeping brain can even make sense out of
information whose relevance is unclear while we are awake and integrate it into
the larger memory system 
13
dreams keep replaying recombining and reintegrating pieces of old
memories for months and even years 
14
 they constantly update the subterranean
realities that determine what our waking minds pay attention to and perhaps
most relevant to emdr in rem sleep we activate more distant associations
than in either non rem sleep or the normal waking state for example when
subjects are wakened from non rem sleep and given a word association test 
they give standard responses hot cold hard soft 
etc 
 wakened from rem sleep 
they make less conventional connections such as thief wrong 
15
 they also solve
simple anagrams more easily after rem sleep this shift toward activation of
distant associations could explain why dreams are so bizarre 
16
stickgold hobson and their colleagues thus discovered that dreams help to
forge new relationships between apparently unrelated memories 
17
 seeing novel
connections is the cardinal feature of creativity as we ve seen it s also essential
to healing the inability to recombine experiences is also one of the striking
features of ptsd while noam in chapter 4 could imagine a trampoline to save
future victims of terrorism traumatized people are trapped in frozen
associations anybody who wears a turban will try to kill me any man who
finds me attractive wants to rape me 
finally stickgold suggests a clear link between emdr and memory
processing in dreams if the bilateral stimulation of emdr can alter brain states
in a manner similar to that seen during rem sleep then there is now good
evidence that emdr should be able to take advantage of sleep dependent
processes which may be blocked or ineffective in ptsd sufferers to allow
effective memory processing and trauma resolution 
18
 the basic emdr
instruction hold that image in your mind and just watch my fingers moving
back and forth may very well reproduce what happens in the dreaming brain 

as this book is going to press ruth lanius and i are studying how the brain
reacts both while remembering a traumatic event and an ordinary experience to
saccadic eye movements as subjects lie in an fmri scanner stay tuned 
association and integration
unlike conventional exposure treatment emdr spends very little time
revisiting the original trauma the trauma itself is certainly the starting point but
the focus is on stimulating and opening up the associative process as our
prozac emdr study showed drugs can blunt the images and sensations of
terror but they remain embedded in the mind and body in contrast with the
subjects who improved on prozac whose memories were merely blunted not
integrated as an event that happened in the past and still caused considerable
anxiety those who received emdr no longer experienced the distinct imprints
of the trauma it had become a story of a terrible event that had happened a long
time ago as one of my patients said making a dismissive hand gesture it s
over 
while we don t yet know precisely how emdr works the same is true of
prozac prozac has an effect on serotonin but whether its levels go up or down 
and in which brain cells and why that makes people feel less afraid is still
unclear we likewise don t know precisely why talking to a trusted friend gives
such profound relief and i am surprised how few people seem eager to explore
that question 
19
clinicians have only one obligation to do whatever they can to help their
patients get better because of this clinical practice has always been a hotbed for
experimentation some experiments fail some succeed and some like emdr 
dialectical behavior therapy and internal family systems therapy go on to
change the way therapy is practiced validating all these treatments takes
decades and is hampered by the fact that research support generally goes to
methods that have already been proven to work i am much comforted by
considering the history of penicillin almost four decades passed between the
discovery of its antibiotic properties by alexander fleming in 1928 and the final
elucidation of its mechanisms in 1965

chapter 16
learning to inhabit your body 
yoga
as we begin to re experience a visceral reconnection with the needs of
our bodies there is a brand new capacity to warmly love the self we
experience a new quality of authenticity in our caring which redirects
our attention to our health our diets our energy our time management 
this enhanced care for the self arises spontaneously and naturally not
as a response to a should we are able to experience an immediate
and intrinsic pleasure in self care 
 stephen cope 
yoga and the quest for the true self
he first time i saw annie she was slumped over in a chair in my waiting
room wearing faded jeans and a purple jimmy cliff t shirt her legs were
visibly shaking and she kept staring at the floor even after i invited her in i had
very little information about her other than that she was forty seven years old
and taught special needs children her body communicated clearly that she was
too terrified to engage in conversation or even to provide routine information
about her address or insurance plan people who are this scared can t think
straight and any demand to perform will only make them shut down further if
you insist they ll run away and you ll never see them again 
annie shuffled into my office and remained standing barely breathing 
looking like a frozen bird i knew we couldn t do anything until i could help her
quiet down moving to within six feet of her and making sure she had
unobstructed access to the door i encouraged her to take slightly deeper breaths 

i breathed with her and asked her to follow my example gently raising my arms
from my sides as she inhaled and lowering them as i exhaled a qigong technique
that one of my chinese students had taught me she stealthily followed my
movements her eyes still fixed on the floor we spent about half an hour this
way from time to time i quietly asked her to notice how her feet felt against the
floor and how her chest expanded and contracted with each breath her breath
gradually became slower and deeper her face softened her spine straightened a
bit and her eyes lifted to about the level of my adam s apple i began to sense
the person behind that overwhelming terror finally she looked more relaxed and
showed me the glimmer of a smile a recognition that we both were in the room 
i suggested that we stop there for now i d made enough demands on her and
asked whether she would like to come back a week later she nodded and
muttered you sure are weird 
as i got to know annie i inferred from the notes she wrote and the
drawings she gave me that she had been dreadfully abused by both her father and
her mother as a very young child the full story was only gradually revealed as
she slowly learned to call up some of the things that had happened to her without
her body being hijacked into uncontrollable anxiety 
i learned that annie was extraordinarily skilled and caring in her work with
special needs kids i tried out quite a few of the techniques she told me about
with the children in our own clinic and found them extremely helpful she
would talk freely about the children she taught but would clam up immediately if
we verged on her relationships with adults i knew she was married but she
barely mentioned her husband she often coped with disagreements and
confrontations by making her mind disappear when she felt overwhelmed she d
cut her arms and breasts with a razor blade she had spent years in various forms
of therapy and had tried many different medications which had done little to
help her deal with the imprints of her horrendous past she had also been
admitted to several psychiatric hospitals to manage her self destructive
behaviors again without much apparent benefit 
in our early therapy sessions because annie could only hint at what she was
feeling and thinking before she would shut down and freeze we focused on
calming the physiological chaos within we used every technique that i had
learned over the years like breathing with a focus on the out breath which
activates the relaxing parasympathetic nervous system i also taught her to use
her fingers to tap a sequence of acupressure points on various parts of her body 
a practice often taught under the name eft emotional freedom technique 

which has been shown to help patients stay within the window of tolerance and
often has positive effects on ptsd symptoms 
1
the legacy of inescapable shock
because we can now identify the brain circuits involved in the alarm system we
know more or less what was happening in annie s brain as she sat that first day
in my waiting room her smoke detector her amygdala had been rewired to
interpret certain situations as harbingers of life threatening danger and it was
sending urgent signals to her survival brain to fight freeze or flee annie had all
these reactions simultaneously she was visibly agitated and mentally shut
down 
as we ve seen broken alarm systems can manifest in various ways and if
your smoke detector malfunctions you cannot trust the accuracy of your
perceptions for example when annie started to like me she began to look
forward to our meetings but she would arrive at my office in an intense panic 
one day she had a flashback of feeling excited that her father was coming home
soon but later that evening he molested her for the first time she realized that
her mind automatically associated excitement about seeing someone she loved
with the terror of being molested 
small children are particularly adept at compartmentalizing experience so
that annie s natural love for her father and her dread of his assaults were held in
separate states of consciousness as an adult annie blamed herself for her abuse 
because she believed that the loving excited little girl she once was had led her
father on that she had brought the molestation upon herself her rational mind
told her this was nonsense but this belief emanated from deep within her
emotional survival brain from the basic wiring of her limbic system it would
not change until she felt safe enough within her body to mindfully go back into
that experience and truly know how that little girl had felt and acted during the
abuse 
the numbing within
one of the ways the memory of helplessness is stored is as muscle tension or
feelings of disintegration in the affected body areas head back and limbs in
accident victims vagina and rectum in victims of sexual abuse the lives of

many trauma survivors come to revolve around bracing against and neutralizing
unwanted sensory experiences and most people i see in my practice have
become experts in such self numbing they may become serially obese or
anorexic or addicted to exercise or work at least half of all traumatized people
try to dull their intolerable inner world with drugs or alcohol the flip side of
numbing is sensation seeking many people cut themselves to make the numbing
go away while others try bungee jumping or high risk activities like prostitution
and gambling any of these methods can give them a false and paradoxical
feeling of control 
when people are chronically angry or scared constant muscle tension
ultimately leads to spasms back pain migraine headaches fibromyalgia and
other forms of chronic pain they may visit multiple specialists undergo
extensive diagnostic tests and be prescribed multiple medications some of
which may provide temporary relief but all of which fail to address the
underlying issues their diagnosis will come to define their reality without ever
being identified as a symptom of their attempt to cope with trauma 
the first two years of my therapy with annie focused on helping her learn
to tolerate her physical sensations for what they were just sensations in the
present with a beginning a middle and an end we worked on helping her stay
calm enough to notice what she felt without judgment so she could observe
these unbidden images and feelings as residues of a terrible past and not as
unending threats to her life today 
patients like annie continuously challenge us to find new ways of helping
people regulate their arousal and control their own physiology that is how my
trauma center colleagues and i stumbled upon yoga 
finding our way to yoga bottom up regulation
our involvement with yoga started in 1998 when jim hopper and i first heard
about a new biological marker heart rate variability hrv that had recently
been discovered to be a good measure of how well the autonomic nervous
system is working as you ll recall from chapter 5 the autonomic nervous
system is our brain s most elementary survival system its two branches
regulating arousal throughout the body roughly speaking the sympathetic
nervous system sns uses chemicals like adrenaline to fuel the body and brain
to take action while the parasympathetic nervous system pns uses
acetylcholine to help regulate basic body functions like digestion wound

healing and sleep and dream cycles when we re at our best these two systems
work closely together to keep us in an optimal state of engagement with our
environment and with ourselves 
heart rate variability measures the relative balance between the sympathetic
and the parasympathetic systems when we inhale we stimulate the sns which
results in an increase in heart rate exhalations stimulate the pns which
decreases how fast the heart beats in healthy individuals inhalations and
exhalations produce steady rhythmical fluctuations in heart rate good heart rate
variability is a measure of basic well being 
why is hrv important when our autonomic nervous system is well
balanced we have a reasonable degree of control over our response to minor
frustrations and disappointments enabling us to calmly assess what is going on
when we feel insulted or left out effective arousal modulation gives us control
over our impulses and emotions as long as we manage to stay calm we can
choose how we want to respond individuals with poorly modulated autonomic
nervous systems are easily thrown off balance both mentally and physically 
since the autonomic nervous system organizes arousal in both body and brain 
poor hrv that is a lack of fluctuation in heart rate in response to breathing 
not only has negative effects on thinking and feeling but also on how the body
responds to stress lack of coherence between breathing and heart rate makes
people vulnerable to a variety of physical illnesses such as heart disease and
cancer in addition to mental problems such as depression and ptsd 
2
in order to study this issue further we acquired a machine to measure hrv
and started to put bands around the chests of research subjects with and without
ptsd to record the depth and rhythm of their breathing while little monitors
attached to their earlobes picked up their pulse after we d tested about sixty
subjects it became clear that people with ptsd have unusually low hrv in
other words in ptsd the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are
out of sync 
3
 this added a new twist to the complicated trauma story we
confirmed that yet another brain regulatory system was not functioning as it
should 
4
 failure to keep this system in balance is one explanation why
traumatized people like annie are so vulnerable to overrespond to relatively
minor stresses the biological systems that are meant to help us cope with the
vagaries of life fail to meet the challenge 
our next scientific question was is there a way for people to improve their
hrv i had a personal incentive to explore this question as i had discovered
that my own hrv was not nearly robust enough to guarantee long term physical

health an internet search turned up studies showing that marathon running
markedly increased hrv sadly that was of little use since neither i nor our
patients were good candidates for the boston marathon google also listed
seventeen thousand yoga sites claiming that that yoga improved hrv but we
were unable to find any supporting studies yogis may have developed a
wonderful method to help people find internal balance and health but back in
1998 not much work had been done on evaluating their claims with the tools of
the western medical tradition 
heart rate variability hrv in a well regulated person 
 the rising and falling black lines
represent breathing in this case slow and regular inhalations and exhalations the gray area shows
fluctuations in heart rate whenever this individual inhales his heart rate goes up during exhalations
the heart slows down this pattern of heart rate variability reflects excellent physiological health 
responding to upset 
 when someone remembers an upsetting experience breathing speeds up and
becomes irregular as does heart rate heart and breath no longer stay perfectly in sync this is a
normal response 
hrv in ptsd 
 breathing is rapid and shallow heart rate is slow and out of synch with the breath 
this is a typical pattern of a shut down person with chronic ptsd 

a person with chronic ptsd reliving a trauma memory 
 breathing initially is labored and deep 
typical of a panic reaction the heart races out of synch with the breath this is followed by rapid 
shallow breathing and slow heart rate signs that the person is shutting down 
since then however scientific methods have confirmed that changing the
way one breathes can improve problems with anger depression and anxiety
5
and that yoga can positively affect such wide ranging medical problems as high
blood pressure elevated stress hormone secretion 
6
 asthma and low back pain 
7
however no psychiatric journal had published a scientific study of yoga for
ptsd until our own work appeared in 2014 
8
as it happened a few days after our internet search a lanky yoga teacher
named david emerson walked through the front door of the trauma center he
told us that he d developed a modified form of hatha yoga to deal with ptsd
and that he d been holding classes for veterans at a local vet center and for
women in the boston area rape crisis center would we be interested in
working with him dave s visit eventually grew into a very active yoga
program and in due course we received the first grant from the national
institutes of health to study the effects of yoga on ptsd dave s work also
contributed to my developing my own regular yoga practice and becoming a
frequent teacher at kripalu a yoga center in the berkshire mountains in western
massachusetts along the way my own hrv pattern improved as well 
in choosing to explore yoga to improve hrv we were taking an expansive
approach to the problem we could simply have used any of a number of
reasonably priced handheld devices that train people to slow their breathing and
synchronize it with their heart rate resulting in a state of cardiac coherence 
like the pattern shown in the first illustration above 
9
 today there are a variety of
apps that can help improve hrv with the aid of a smartphone 
10
 in our clinic we
have workstations where patients can train their hrv and i urge all my patients
who for one reason or another cannot practice yoga martial arts or qigong to
train themselves at home see resources for more information 
exploring yoga

our decision to study yoga led us deeper into trauma s impact on the body our
first experimental yoga classes met in a room generously donated by a nearby
studio david emerson and his colleagues dana moore and jodi carey
volunteered as instructors and my research team figured out how we could best
measure yoga s effects on psychological functioning we put flyers in
neighborhood supermarkets and laundromats to advertise our classes and
interviewed dozens of people who called in response ultimately we selected
thirty seven women who had severe trauma histories and who had already
received many years of therapy without much benefit half the volunteers were
selected at random for the yoga group while the others would receive a well 
established mental health treatment dialectical behavior therapy dbt which
teaches people how to apply mindfulness to stay calm and in control finally we
commissioned an engineer at mit to build us a complicated computer that could
measure hrv simultaneously in eight different people in each study group
there were multiple classes each with no more than eight participants while
yoga significantly improved arousal problems in ptsd and dramatically
improved our subjects relationships to their bodies i now take care of my
body i listen to what my body needs eight weeks of dbt did not affect
their arousal levels or ptsd symptoms thus our interest in yoga gradually
evolved from a focus on learning whether yoga can change hrv which it can 
11
to helping traumatized people learn to comfortably inhabit their tortured bodies 
over time we also started a yoga program for marines at camp lejeune and
have worked successfully with various other programs to implement yoga
programs for veterans with ptsd even though we have no formal research data
on the veterans it looks as if yoga is at least as effective for them as it has been
for the women in our studies 
all yoga programs consist of a combination of breath practices
 
pranayama
 stretches or postures 
asanas
 and meditation different schools
of yoga emphasize variations in intensity and focus within these core
components for example variations in the speed and depth of breathing and use
of the mouth nostrils and throat all produce different results and some
techniques have powerful effects on energy 
12
 in our classes we keep the
approach simple many of our patients are barely aware of their breath so
learning to focus on the in and out breath to notice whether the breath was fast
or slow and to count breaths in some poses can be a significant
accomplishment 
13
we gradually introduce a limited number of classic postures the emphasis

is not on getting the poses right but on helping the participants notice which
muscles are active at different times the sequences are designed to create a
rhythm between tension and relaxation something we hope they will begin to
perceive in their day to day lives 
we do not teach meditation as such but we do foster mindfulness by
encouraging students to observe what is happening in different parts of the body
from pose to pose in our studies we keep seeing how difficult it is for
traumatized people to feel completely relaxed and physically safe in their bodies 
we measure our subjects hrv by placing tiny monitors on their arms during
shavasana
 the pose at the end of most classes during which practitioners lie face
up palms up arms and legs relaxed instead of relaxation we picked up too
much muscle activity to get a clear signal rather than going into a state of quiet
repose our students muscles often continue to prepare them to fight unseen
enemies a major challenge in recovering from trauma remains being able to
achieve a state of total relaxation and safe surrender 
learning self regulation
after seeing the success of our pilot studies we established a therapeutic yoga
program at the trauma center i thought that this might be an opportunity for
annie to develop a more caring relationship with her body and i urged her to try
it the first class was difficult merely being given an adjustment by the
instructor was so terrifying that she went home and slashed herself her
malfunctioning alarm system interpreted even a gentle touch on her back as an
assault at the same time annie realized that yoga might offer her a way to
liberate herself from the constant sense of danger that she felt in her body with
my encouragement she returned the following week 
annie had always found it easier to write about her experiences than to talk
about them after her second yoga class she wrote to me i don t know all of
the reasons that yoga terrifies me so much but i do know that it will be an
incredible source of healing for me and that is why i am working on myself to
try it yoga is about looking inward instead of outward and listening to my body 
and a lot of my survival has been geared around never doing those things going
to the class today my heart was racing and part of me really wanted to turn
around but then i just kept putting one foot in front of the other until i got to the
door and went in after the class i came home and slept for four hours this
week i tried doing yoga at home and the words came to me your body has

things to say i said back to myself i will try and listen 
a few days later annie wrote some thoughts during and after yoga today 
it occurred to me how disconnected i must be from my body when i cut it when
i was doing the poses i noticed that my jaw and the whole area from where my
legs end to my bellybutton is where i am tight tense and holding the pain and
memories sometimes you have asked me where i feel things and i can t even
begin to locate them but today i felt those places very clearly and it made me
want to cry in a gentle kind of way 
the following month both of us went on vacation and invited to stay in
touch annie wrote to me again i ve been doing yoga on my own in a room
that overlooks the lake i m continuing to read the book you lent me stephen
cope s wonderful 
yoga and the quest for the true self
 it s really interesting to
think about how much i have been refusing to listen to my body which is such
an important part of who i am yesterday when i did yoga i thought about letting
my body tell me the story it wants to tell and in the hip opening poses there was
a lot of pain and sadness i don t think my mind is going to let really vivid
images come up as long as i am away from home which is good i think now
about how unbalanced i have been and about how hard i have tried to deny the
past which is a part of my true self there is so much i can learn if i am open to
it and then i won t have to fight myself every minute of every day 
one of the hardest yoga positions for annie to tolerate was one that s often
called happy baby in which you lie on your back with your knees deeply bent
and the soles of your feet pointing to the ceiling while holding your toes with
your hands this rotates the pelvis into a wide open position it s easy to
understand why this would make a rape victim feel extremely vulnerable yet as
long as happy baby or any posture that resembles it precipitates intense panic 
it is difficult to be intimate learning how to comfortably assume happy baby is
a challenge for many patients in our yoga classes 
getting to know me cultivating interoception
one of the clearest lessons from contemporary neuroscience is that our sense of
ourselves is anchored in a vital connection with our bodies 
14
 we do not truly
know ourselves unless we can feel and interpret our physical sensations we need
to register and act on these sensations to navigate safely through life 
15
 while
numbing or compensatory sensation seeking may make life tolerable the price

you pay is that you lose awareness of what is going on inside your body and 
with that the sense of being fully sensually alive 
in chapter 6 i discussed alexithymia the technical term for not being able to
identify what is going on inside oneself 
16
 people who suffer from alexithymia
tend to feel physically uncomfortable but cannot describe exactly what the
problem is as a result they often have multiple vague and distressing physical
complaints that doctors can t diagnose in addition they can t figure out for
themselves what they re really feeling about any given situation or what makes
them feel better or worse this is the result of numbing which keeps them from
anticipating and responding to the ordinary demands of their bodies in quiet 
mindful ways at the same time it muffles the everyday sensory delights of
experiences like music touch and light which imbue life with value yoga
turned out to be a terrific way to re gain a relationship with the interior world
and with it a caring loving sensual relationship to the self 
if you are not aware of what your body needs you can t take care of it if
you don t feel hunger you can t nourish yourself if you mistake anxiety for
hunger you may eat too much and if you can t feel when you re satiated you ll
keep eating this is why cultivating sensory awareness is such a critical aspect of
trauma recovery most traditional therapies downplay or ignore the moment to 
moment shifts in our inner sensory world but these shifts carry the essence of
the organism s responses the emotional states that are imprinted in the body s
chemical profile in the viscera in the contraction of the striated muscles of the
face throat trunk and limbs 
17
 traumatized people need to learn that they can
tolerate their sensations befriend their inner experiences and cultivate new
action patterns 
in yoga you focus your attention on your breathing and on your sensations
moment to moment you begin to notice the connection between your emotions
and your body perhaps how anxiety about doing a pose actually throws you off
balance you begin to experiment with changing the way you feel will taking a
deep breath relieve that tension in your shoulder will focusing on your
exhalations produce a sense of calm 
18
simply noticing what you feel fosters emotional regulation and it helps you
to stop trying to ignore what is going on inside you as i often tell my students 
the two most important phrases in therapy as in yoga are notice that and
 what happens next once you start approaching your body with curiosity
rather than with fear everything shifts 
body awareness also changes your sense of time trauma makes you feel as

if you are stuck forever in a helpless state of horror in yoga you learn that
sensations rise to a peak and then fall for example if an instructor invites you
to enter a particularly challenging position you may at first feel a sense of defeat
or resistance anticipating that you won t be able to tolerate the feelings brought
up by this particular position a good yoga teacher will encourage you to just
notice any tension while timing what you feel with the flow of your breath 
 we ll be holding this position for ten breaths this helps you anticipate the end
of discomfort and strengthens your capacity to deal with physical and emotional
distress awareness that all experience is transitory changes your perspective on
yourself 
this is not to say that regaining interoception isn t potentially upsetting 
what happens when a newly accessed feeling in your chest is experienced as
rage or fear or anxiety in our first yoga study we had a 50 percent dropout
rate the highest of any study we d ever done when we interviewed the patients
who d left we learned that they had found the program too intense any posture
that involved the pelvis could precipitate intense panic or even flashbacks to
sexual assaults intense physical sensations unleashed the demons from the past
that had been so carefully kept in check by numbing and inattention this taught
us to go slow often at a snail s pace that approach paid off in our most recent
study only one out of thirty four participants did not finish 

effects of a weekly yoga class 
 after twenty weeks chronically traumatized women developed
increased activation of critical brain structures involved in self regulation the insula and the medial
prefrontal cortex 
yoga and the neuroscience of self awareness
during the past few years brain researchers such as my colleagues sara lazar
and britta h lzel at harvard have shown that intensive meditation has a positive
effect on exactly those brain areas that are critical for physiological self 
regulation 
19
 in our latest yoga study with six women with histories of profound
early trauma we also found the first indications that twenty weeks of yoga
practice increased activation of the basic self system the insula and the medial
prefrontal cortex see chapter 6 this research needs much more work but it
opens up new perspectives on how actions that involve noticing and befriending
the sensations in our bodies can produce profound changes in both mind and
brain that can lead to healing from trauma 
after each of our yoga studies we asked the participants what effect the
classes had had on them we never mentioned the insula or interoception in fact 

we kept the discussion and explanation to a minimum so that they could focus
inward 
here is a sample of their responses 
 my emotions feel more powerful maybe it s just that i can
recognize them now 
 i can express my feelings more because i can recognize them more 
i feel them in my body recognize them and address them 
 i now see choices multiple paths i can decide and i can choose my
life it doesn t have to be repeated or be experienced like a child 
 i was able to move my body and be in my body in a safe place and
without hurting myself getting hurt 
learning to communicate
people who feel safe in their bodies can begin to translate the memories that
previously overwhelmed them into language after annie had been practicing
yoga three times a week for about a year she noticed that she was able to talk
much more freely to me about what had happened to her she thought this almost
miraculous one day when she knocked over a glass of water i got up from my
chair and approached her with a kleenex box saying let me clean that up 
this precipitated a brief intense panic reaction she was quickly able to contain
herself though and explained why those particular words were so upsetting to
her they were what her father would say after he d raped her annie wrote to
me after that session did you notice that i have been able to say the words out
loud i didn t have to write them down to tell you what was happening i didn t
lose trust in you because you said words that triggered me i understood that the
words were a trigger and not terrible words that no one should say 
annie continues to practice yoga and to write to me about her experiences 
 today i went to a morning yoga class at my new yoga studio the teacher
talked about breathing to the edge of where we can and then noticing that edge 
she said that if we notice our breath we are in the present because we can t
breathe in the future or the past it felt so amazing to me to be practicing
breathing in that way after we had just talked about it like i had been given a
gift some of the poses can be triggering for me two of them were today one
where your legs are up frog like and one where you are doing really deep
breathing into your pelvis i felt the beginning of panic especially in the

breathing pose like oh no that s not a part of my body i want to feel but then i
was able to stop myself and just say notice that this part of your body is holding
experiences and then just let it go you don t have to stay there but you don t
have to leave either just use it as information i don t know that i have ever been
able to do that in such a conscious way before it made me think that if i notice
without being so afraid it will be easier for me to believe myself 
in another message annie reflected on the changes in her life i slowly
learned to just have my feelings without being hijacked by them life is more
manageable i am more attuned to my day and more present in the moment i am
more tolerant of physical touch my husband and i are enjoying watching
movies cuddled together in bed a huge step all this helped me finally feel
intimate with my husband

the principles of psychology
t was early in my career and i had been seeing mary a shy lonely and
physically collapsed young woman for about three months in weekly
psychotherapy dealing with the ravages of her terrible history of early abuse 
one day i opened the door to my waiting room and saw her standing there
provocatively dressed in a miniskirt her hair dyed flaming red with a cup of
coffee in one hand and a snarl on her face you must be dr van der kolk she
said my name is jane and i came to warn you not to believe any the lies that
mary has been telling you can i come in and tell you about her i was stunned
but fortunately kept myself from confronting jane and instead heard her out 

over the course of our session i met not only jane but also a hurt little girl and
an angry male adolescent that was the beginning of a long and productive
treatment 
mary was my first encounter with dissociative identity disorder did 
which at that time was called multiple personality disorder as dramatic as its
symptoms are the internal splitting and emergence of distinct identities
experienced in did represent only the extreme end of the spectrum of mental
life the sense of being inhabited by warring impulses or parts is common to all
of us but particularly to traumatized people who had to resort to extreme
measures in order to survive exploring even befriending those parts is an
important component of healing 
desperate times require desperate measures
we all know what happens when we feel humiliated we put all our energy into
protecting ourselves developing whatever survival strategies we can we may
repress our feelings we may get furious and plot revenge we may decide to
become so powerful and successful that nobody can ever hurt us again many
behaviors that are classified as psychiatric problems including some obsessions 
compulsions and panic attacks as well as most self destructive behaviors 
started out as strategies for self protection these adaptations to trauma can so
interfere with the capacity to function that health care providers and patients
themselves often believe that full recovery is beyond reach viewing these
symptoms as permanent disabilities narrows the focus of treatment to finding the
proper drug regimen which can lead to lifelong dependence as though trauma
survivors were like kidney patients on dialysis 
1
it is much more productive to see aggression or depression arrogance or
passivity as learned behaviors somewhere along the line the patient came to
believe that he or she could survive only if he or she was tough invisible or
absent or that it was safer to give up like traumatic memories that keep
intruding until they are laid to rest traumatic adaptations continue until the
human organism feels safe and integrates all the parts of itself that are stuck in
fighting or warding off the trauma 
every trauma survivor i ve met is resilient in his or her own way and every
one of their stories inspires awe at how people cope knowing how much energy
the sheer act of survival requires keeps me from being surprised at the price they

often pay the absence of a loving relationship with their own bodies minds and
souls 
coping takes its toll for many children it is safer to hate themselves than to
risk their relationship with their caregivers by expressing anger or by running
away as a result abused children are likely to grow up believing that they are
fundamentally unlovable that was the only way their young minds could explain
why they were treated so badly they survive by denying ignoring and splitting
off large chunks of reality they forget the abuse they suppress their rage or
despair they numb their physical sensations if you were abused as a child you
are likely to have a childlike part living inside you that is frozen in time still
holding fast to this kind of self loathing and denial many adults who survive
terrible experiences are caught in the same trap pushing away intense feelings
can be highly adaptive in the short run it may help you preserve your dignity
and independence it may help you maintain focus on critical tasks like saving a
comrade taking care of your kids or rebuilding your house 
the problems come later after seeing a friend blown up a soldier may
return to civilian life and try to put the experience out of his mind a protective
part of him knows how to be competent at his job and how to get along with
colleagues but he may habitually erupt in rage at his girlfriend or become numb
and frozen when the pleasure of surrendering to her touch makes him feel he is
losing control he probably will not be aware that his mind automatically
associates passive surrender with the paralysis he felt when his friend was killed 
so another protective part steps in to create a diversion he gets angry and 
having no idea what set him off he thinks he s mad about something his
girlfriend did of course if he keeps blowing up at her and subsequent
girlfriends he will become more and more isolated but he may never realize
that a traumatized part is triggered by passivity and that another part an angry
manager is stepping in to protect that vulnerable part helping these parts to
give up their extreme beliefs is how therapy can save people s lives 
as we saw in chapter 13 a central task for recovery from trauma is to learn
to live with the memories of the past without being overwhelmed by them in the
present but most survivors including those who are functioning well even
brilliantly in some aspects of their lives face another even greater challenge 
reconfiguring a brain mind system that was constructed to cope with the worst 
just as we need to revisit traumatic memories in order to integrate them we need
to revisit the parts of ourselves that developed the defensive habits that helped us
to survive 

the mind is a mosaic
we all have parts right now a part of me feels like taking a nap another part
wants to keep writing still feeling injured by an offensive e mail message a part
of me wants to hit reply on a stinging put down while a different part wants to
shrug it off most people who know me have seen my intense sincere and
irritable parts some have met the little snarling dog that lives inside me my
children reminisce about going on family vacations with my playful and
adventurous parts 
when you walk into the office in the morning and see the storm clouds over
your boss s head you know precisely what is coming that angry part has a
characteristic tone of voice vocabulary and body posture so different from
yesterday when you shared pictures of your kids parts are not just feelings but
distinct ways of being with their own beliefs agendas and roles in the overall
ecology of our lives 
how well we get along with ourselves depends largely on our internal
leadership skills how well we listen to our different parts make sure they feel
taken care of and keep them from sabotaging one another parts often come
across as absolutes when in fact they represent only one element in a complex
constellation of thoughts emotions and sensations if margaret shouts i hate
you in the middle of an argument joe probably thinks she despises him and
in that moment margaret might agree but in fact only a part of her is angry and
that part temporarily obscures her generous and affectionate feelings which may
well return when she sees the devastation on joe s face 
every major school of psychology recognizes that people have
subpersonalities and gives them different names 
2
 in 1890 william james wrote 
 i t must be admitted that the total possible consciousness may be split into
parts which coexist but mutually ignore each other and share the objects of
knowledge between them 
3
 carl jung wrote the psyche is a self regulating
system that maintains its equilibrium just as the body does 
4
 the natural state
of the human psyche consists in a jostling together of its components and in their
contradictory behavior 
5
 and the reconciliation of these opposites is a major
problem thus the adversary is none other than the other in me 
6
modern neuroscience has confirmed this notion of the mind as a kind of
society michael gazzaniga who conducted pioneering split brain research 
concluded that the mind is composed of semiautonomous functioning modules 
each of which has a special role 
7
 in his book 
the social brain 
 1985 he writes 

 but what of the idea that the self is not a unified being and there may exist
within us several realms of consciousness from our split brain studies the
new idea emerges that there are literally several selves and they do not
necessarily converse with each other internally 
8
 mit scientist marvin
minsky a pioneer of artificial intelligence declared the legend of the single
self can only divert us from the target of that inquiry 
9
 i t can make sense to
think there exists inside your brain a society of different minds like members
of a family the different minds can work together to help each other each still
having its own mental experiences that the others never know about 
10
therapists who are trained to see people as complex human beings with
multiple characteristics and potentialities can help them explore their system of
inner parts and take care of the wounded facets of themselves there are several
such treatment approaches including the structural dissociation model
developed by my dutch colleagues onno van der hart and ellert nijenhuis and
atlanta based kathy steel that is widely practiced in europe and richard
kluft s work in the united states 
11
twenty years after working with mary i met richard schwartz the
developer of internal family systems therapy ifs it was through his work that
minsky s family metaphor truly came to life for me and offered a systematic
way to work with the split off parts that result from trauma at the core of ifs is
the notion that the mind of each of us is like a family in which the members have
different levels of maturity excitability wisdom and pain the parts form a
network or system in which change in any one part will affect all the others 
the ifs model helped me realize that dissociation occurs on a continuum in
trauma the self system breaks down and parts of the self become polarized and
go to war with one another self loathing coexists and fights with grandiosity 
loving care with hatred numbing and passivity with rage and aggression these
extreme parts bear the burden of the trauma 
in ifs a part is considered not just a passing emotional state or customary
thought pattern but a distinct mental system with its own history abilities needs 
and worldview 
12
 trauma injects parts with beliefs and emotions that hijack
them out of their naturally valuable state for example we all have parts that are
childlike and fun when we are abused these are the parts that are hurt the most 
and they become frozen carrying the pain terror and betrayal of abuse this
burden makes them toxic parts of ourselves that we need to deny at all costs 
because they are locked away inside ifs calls them the 
exiles 
at this point other parts organize to protect the internal family from the

exiles these protectors keep the toxic parts away but in so doing they take on
some of the energy of the abuser critical and perfectionistic 
managers
 can make
sure we never get close to anyone or drive us to be relentlessly productive 
another group of protectors which ifs calls 
firefighters
 are emergency
responders acting impulsively whenever an experience triggers an exiled
emotion 
each split off part holds different memories beliefs and physical
sensations some hold the shame others the rage some the pleasure and
excitement another the intense loneliness or the abject compliance these are all
aspects of the abuse experience the critical insight is that all these parts have a
function to protect the self from feeling the full terror of annihilation 
children who act out their pain rather than locking it down are often
diagnosed with oppositional defiant behavior attachment disorder or
 conduct disorder but these labels ignore the fact that rage and withdrawal are
only facets of a whole range of desperate attempts at survival trying to control a
child s behavior while failing to address the underlying issue the abuse leads
to treatments that are ineffective at best and harmful at worst as they grow up 
their parts do not spontaneously integrate into a coherent personality but
continue to lead a relatively autonomous existence 
parts that are out may be entirely unaware of the other parts of the
system 
13
 most of the men i evaluated with regard to their childhood molestation
by catholic priests took anabolic steroids and spent an inordinate amount of time
in the gym pumping iron these compulsive bodybuilders lived in a masculine
culture of sweat football and beer where weakness and fear were carefully
concealed only after they felt safe with me did i meet the terrified kids inside 
patients may also dislike the parts that are out the parts that are angry 
destructive or critical but ifs offers a framework for understanding them 
and also important talking about them in a nonpathologizing way recognizing
that each part is stuck with burdens from the past and respecting its function in
the overall system makes it feel less threatening or overwhelming 
as schwartz states if one accepts the basic idea that people have an innate
drive toward nurturing their own health this implies that when people have
chronic problems something gets in the way of accessing inner resources 
recognizing this the role of therapists is to collaborate rather than to teach 
confront or fill holes in your psyche 
14
 the first step in this collaboration is to
assure the internal system that all parts are welcome and that all of them even
those that are suicidal or destructive were formed in an attempt to protect the

self system no matter how much they now seem to threaten it 
self leadership
ifs recognizes that the cultivation of mindful self leadership is the foundation
for healing from trauma mindfulness not only makes it possible to survey our
internal landscape with compassion and curiosity but can also actively steer us in
the right direction for self care all systems families organizations or nations
 can operate effectively only if they have clearly defined and competent
leadership the internal family is no different all facets of our selves need to be
attended to the internal leader must wisely distribute the available resources
and supply a vision for the whole that takes all the parts into account 
as richard schwartz explains 
the internal system of an abuse victim differs from the non abuse
system with regard to the consistent absence of effective leadership the
extreme rules under which the parts function and the absence of any
consistent balance or harmony typically the parts operate around
outdated assumptions and beliefs derived from the childhood abuse 
believing for example that it is still extremely dangerous to reveal
secrets about childhood experiences which were endured 
15
what happens when the self is no longer in charge ifs calls this
 blending a condition in which the self identifies with a part as in i want to
kill myself or i hate you notice the difference from a part of me wishes
that i were dead or a part of me gets triggered when you do that and makes
me want to kill you 
schwartz makes two assertions that extend the concept of mindfulness into
the realm of active leadership the first is that this self does not need to be
cultivated or developed beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma
survivors there exists an undamaged essence a self that is confident curious 
and calm a self that has been sheltered from destruction by the various
protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival once those
protectors trust that it is safe to separate the self will spontaneously emerge and
the parts can be enlisted in the healing process 
the second assumption is that rather than being a passive observer this

mindful self can help reorganize the inner system and communicate with the
parts in ways that help those parts trust that there is someone inside who can
handle things again neuroscience research shows that this is not just a
metaphor mindfulness increases activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and
decreases activation of structures like the amygdala that trigger our emotional
responses this increases our control over the emotional brain 
even more than encouraging a relationship between a therapist and a
helpless patient ifs focuses on cultivating an inner relationship between the
self and the various protective parts in this model of treatment the self doesn t
only witness or passively observe as in some meditation traditions it has an
active leadership role the self is like an orchestra conductor who helps all the
parts to function harmoniously as a symphony rather than a cacophony 
getting to know the internal landscape
the task of the therapist is to help patients separate this confusing blend into
separate entities so that they are able to say this part of me is like a little
child and that part of me is more mature but feels like a victim they might not
like many of these parts but identifying them makes them less intimidating or
overwhelming the next step is to encourage patients to simply ask each
protective part as it emerges to stand back temporarily so that we can see what
it is protecting when this is done again and again the parts begin to unblend
from the self and make space for mindful self observation patients learn to put
their fear rage or disgust on hold and open up into states of curiosity and self 
reflection from the stable perspective of self they can begin constructive inner
dialogues with their parts 
patients are asked to identify the part involved in the current problem like
feeling worthless abandoned or obsessed with vengeful thoughts as they ask
themselves what inside me feels that way an image may come to mind 
16
maybe the depressed part looks like an abandoned child or an aging man or an
overwhelmed nurse taking care of the wounded a vengeful part might appear as
a combat marine or a member of a street gang 
next the therapist asks how do you feel toward that sad vengeful 
terrified part of you this sets the stage for mindful self observation by
separating the you from the part in question if the patient has an extreme
response like i hate it the therapist knows that there is another protective part

blended with self he or she might then ask see if the part that hates it would
step back then the protective part is often thanked for its vigilance and assured
that it can return anytime that it is needed if the protective part is willing the
follow up question is how do you feel toward the previously rejected part
now the patient is likely to say something like i wonder why it is so sad 
vengeful etc this sets the stage for getting to know the part better for
example by inquiring how old it is and how it came to feel the way it does 
once a patient manifests a critical mass of self this kind of dialogue begins
to take place spontaneously at this point it s important for the therapist to step
aside and just keep an eye out for other parts that might interfere or make
occasional empathic comments or ask questions like what do you say to the
part about that or where do you want to go now or what feels like the
right next step as well as the ubiquitous self detecting question how do you
feel toward the part now 
a life in parts
joan came to see me to help her manage her uncontrollable temper tantrums and
to deal with her guilt about her numerous affairs most recently with her tennis
coach as she put it in our first session i go from being a kick ass professional
woman to a whimpering child to a furious bitch to a pitiless eating machine in
the course of ten minutes i have no idea which of these i really am 
by this point in the session joan had already critiqued the prints on my
wall my rickety furniture and my messy desk offense was her best defense 
she was preparing to get hurt again i d probably let her down as so many
people had before she knew that for therapy to work she d have to make
herself vulnerable so she had to find out if i could tolerate her anger fear and
sorrow i realized that the only way to counter her defensiveness was by showing
a high level of interest in the details of her life demonstrating unwavering
support for the risk she took in talking with me and accepting the parts she was
most ashamed of 
i asked joan if she had noticed the part of herself that was critical she
acknowledged that she had and i asked her how she felt toward that critic this
key question allowed her to begin to separate from that part and to access her
self joan responded that she hated the critic because it reminded her of her
mother when i asked her what that critical part might be protecting her anger
subsided and she became more curious and thoughtful i wonder why she finds

it necessary to call me some of the same names that my mother used to call me 
and worse she talked about how scared she had been of her mom growing up
and how she felt that she never could do anything right the critic was obviously
a manager not only was it protecting joan from me but it was trying to preempt
her mother s criticism 
over the next few weeks joan told me that she had been sexually molested
by her mother s boyfriend probably around the time she was in the first or
second grade she thought she d been ruined for intimate relationships while
she was demanding and critical of her husband for whom she lacked any sexual
desire she was passionate and reckless in her love affairs but the affairs always
ended in a similar way in the middle of a lovemaking session she would
suddenly become terrified and curl up into a ball whimpering like a little girl 
these scenes left her confused and disgusted and afterward she could not bear
to have anything more to do with her lover 
like marilyn in chapter 8 joan told me that she had learned to make herself
disappear when she was being molested floating above the scene as if it were
happening to some other girl pushing the molestation out of her mind had
enabled joan to have a normal school life of sleepovers girlfriends and team
sports the trouble began in adolescence when she developed her pattern of
frigid contempt for boys who treated her well and having casual sex that left her
humiliated and ashamed she told me that bulimia for her was what orgasms
must be for other people and having sex with her husband for her was what
vomiting must be for others while specific memories of her abuse were split off
 dissociated she unwittingly kept reenacting it 
i did not try to explain to her why she felt so angry guilty or shut down 
she already thought of herself as damaged goods in therapy as in memory
processing pendulation the gradual approach that i discussed in chapter 13 is
central for joan to be able to deal with her misery and hurt we would have to
recruit her own strength and self love enabling her to heal herself 
this meant focusing on her many inner resources and reminding myself that
i could not provide her with the love and caring she had missed as a child if as
a therapist teacher or mentor you try to fill the holes of early deprivation you
come up against the fact that you are the wrong person at the wrong time in the
wrong place the therapy would focus on joan s relationship with her parts
rather than with me 

meeting the managers
as joan s treatment progressed we identified many different parts that were in
charge at different times an aggressive childlike part that threw tantrums a
promiscuous adolescent part a suicidal part an obsessive manager a prissy
moralist and so on as usual we met the managers first their job was to
prevent humiliation and abandonment and to keep her organized and safe some
managers may be aggressive like joan s critic while others are perfectionistic or
reserved careful not to draw too much attention to themselves they may tell us
to turn a blind eye to what is going on and keep us passive to avoid risk internal
managers also control how much access we have to emotions so that the self 
system doesn t get overwhelmed 
it requires an enormous amount of energy to keep the system under control 
a single flirtatious comment may trigger several parts simultaneously one that
becomes intensely sexually aroused another filled with self loathing a third that
tries to calm things down by self cutting other managers create obsessions and
distractions or deny reality altogether but each part should be approached as an
internal protector who maintains an important defensive position managers
carry huge burdens of responsibility and usually are in over their heads 
some managers are extremely competent many of my patients hold
responsible positions do outstanding professional jobs and can be superbly
attentive parents joan s critical manager undoubtedly contributed to her success
as an ophthalmologist i have had numerous patients who were highly skilled
teachers or nurses while their colleagues may have experienced them as a bit
distant or reserved they would probably have been astonished to discover that
their exemplary coworkers engaged in self mutilation eating disorders or
bizarre sexual practices 
gradually joan started to realize that it is normal to simultaneously
experience conflicting feelings or thoughts which gave her more confidence to
face the task ahead instead of believing that hate consumed her entire being she
learned that only a part of her felt paralyzed by it however after a negative
evaluation at work joan went into a tailspin berating herself for not protecting
herself then feeling clingy weak and powerless when i asked her to see where
that powerless part was located in her body and how she felt toward it she
resisted she told me she couldn t stand that whiny incompetent girl who made
her feel embarrassed and contemptuous of herself i suspected that this part held
much of the memory of her abuse and i decided not to pressure her at this point 

she left my office withdrawn and upset 
the next day she raided the refrigerator and then spent hours vomiting up
her food when she returned to my office she told me she wanted to kill herself
and was surprised that i seemed genuinely curious and nonjudgmental and that i
did not condemn her for either her bulimia or her suicidality when i asked her
what parts were involved the critic came back and blurted out she is
disgusting when she asked that part to step back the next part said nobody
will ever love me followed again by the critic who told me that the best way to
help her would be to ignore all that noise and to increase her medications 
clearly in their desire to protect her injured parts these managers were
unintentionally doing her harm so i kept asking them what they thought would
happen if they stepped back joan answered people will hate me and i will
be all alone and out in the street this was followed by a memory her mother
had told her that if she disobeyed she would be put up for adoption and never
see her sisters or her dog again when i asked her how she felt about that scared
girl inside she cried and said that she felt bad for her now her self was back 
and i was confident that we had calmed the system down but this session turned
out to be too much too soon 
putting out the flames
the following week joan missed her appointment we had triggered her exiles 
and her firefighters went on a rampage as she told me later the evening after
we talked about her terror of being put into foster care she felt as if she were
going to blast out of herself she went to a bar and picked up a guy coming
home late drunk and disheveled she refused to talk to her husband and fell
asleep in the den the next morning she acted as if nothing had happened 
firefighters will do anything to make emotional pain go away aside from
sharing the task of keeping the exiles locked up they are the opposite of
managers managers are all about staying in control while firefighters will
destroy the house in order to extinguish the fire the struggle between uptight
managers and out of control firefighters will continue until the exiles which
carry the burden of the trauma are allowed to come home and be cared for 
anyone who deals with survivors will encounter those firefighters i ve met
firefighters who shop drink play computer games addictively have impulsive
affairs or exercise compulsively a sordid encounter can blunt the abused child s
horror and shame if only for a couple of hours 

it is critical to remember that at their core firefighters are also desperately
trying to protect the system unlike managers who are usually superficially
cooperative during therapy firefighters don t hold back they hurl insults and
storm out of the room firefighters are frantic and if you ask them what would
happen if they stopped doing their job you discover that they believe the exiled
feelings would crash the entire self system they are also oblivious to the idea
that there are better ways to guarantee physical and emotional safety and even if
behaviors like bingeing or cutting stop firefighters often find other methods of
self harm these cycles will come to an end only when the self is able to take
charge and the system feels safe 
the burden of toxicity
exiles are the toxic waste dump of the system because they hold the memories 
sensations beliefs and emotions associated with trauma it is hazardous to
release them they contain the oh my god i m done for experience the
essence of inescapable shock and with it terror collapse and accommodation 
exiles may reveal themselves in the form of crushing physical sensations or
extreme numbing and they offend both the reasonableness of the managers and
the bravado of the firefighters 
like most incest survivors joan hated her exiles particularly the little girl
who had responded to her abuser s sexual demands and the terrified child who
whimpered alone in her bed when exiles overwhelm managers they take us
over we are nothing but that rejected weak unloved and abandoned child 
the self becomes blended with the exiles and every possible alternative for
our life is eclipsed then as schwartz points out we see ourselves and the
world through their eyes and believe it is the world in this state it won t occur
to us that we have been hijacked 
17
keeping the exiles locked up however stamps out not only memories and
emotions but also the parts that hold them the parts that were hurt the most by
the trauma in schwartz s words usually those are your most sensitive 
creative intimacy loving lively playful and innocent parts by exiling them
when they get hurt they suffer a double whammy the insult of your rejection is
added to their original injury 
18
 as joan discovered keeping the exiles hidden
and despised was condemning her to a life without intimacy or genuine joy 

unlocking the past
several months into joan s treatment we again accessed the exiled girl who
carried the humiliation confusion and shame of joan s molestation by then she
had come to trust me enough and had developed enough sense of self to be able
to tolerate observing herself as a child with all her long buried feelings of terror 
excitement surrender and complicity she did not say very much during this
process and my main job was to keep her in a state of calm self observation 
she often had the impulse to pull away in disgust and horror leaving this
unacceptable child alone in her misery at these points i asked her protectors to
step back so that she could keep listening to what her little girl wanted her to
know 
finally with my encouragement she was able to rush into the scene and
take the girl away with her to a safe place she firmly told her abuser that she
would never let him get close to her again instead of denying the child she
played an active role in liberating her as in emdr the resolution of the trauma
was the result of her ability to access her imagination and rework the scenes in
which she had become frozen so long ago helpless passivity was replaced by
determined self led action 
once joan started to own her impulses and behaviors she recognized the
emptiness of her relationship with her husband brian and began to insist on
change i invited her to ask brian to meet with us and she was present for eight
sessions before he began to see me individually 
schwartz observes that ifs can help family members mentor each other as
they learn to observe how one person s parts interact with another s i witnessed
this firsthand with joan and brian brian was initially quite proud of having put
up with joan s behavior for so long feeling that she really needed him had kept
him from even considering divorce but now that she wanted more intimacy he
felt pressured and inadequate revealing a panicked part that blanked out and
put up a wall against feeling 
gradually brian began to talk about growing up in an alcoholic family
where behaviors like joan s were common and largely ignored punctuated by
his father s stays in detox centers and his mother s long hospitalizations for
depression and suicide attempts when i asked his panicked part what would
happen if it allowed brian to feel anything he revealed his fear of being
overwhelmed by pain the pain of his childhood added to the pain of his
relationship with joan 

over the next few weeks other parts emerged first came a protector that
was frightened of women and determined never to let brian become vulnerable
to their manipulations then we discovered a strong caretaker part that had
looked after his mother and his younger siblings this part gave brian a feeling
of self worth and purpose and a way of dealing with his own terror finally 
brian was ready to meet his exile the scared essentially motherless child who d
had no one to care for him 
this is a very short version of a long exploration which involved many
diversions as when joan s critic reemerged from time to time but from the
beginning ifs helped joan and brian hear themselves and each other from the
perspective of an objective curious and compassionate self they were no
longer locked in the past and a whole range of new possibilities opened up for
them 
the power of self compassion ifs in the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
nancy shadick is a rheumatologist at boston s brigham and women s hospital
who combines medical research on rheumatoid arthritis ra with a strong
interest in her patients personal experience of their illness when she discovered
ifs at a workshop with richard schwartz she decided to incorporate the therapy
into a study of psychosocial intervention with ra patients 
ra is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammatory disorders throughout
the body causing chronic pain and disability medication can delay its progress
and relieve some of the pain but there is no cure and living with ra can lead to
depression anxiety isolation and overall impaired quality of life i followed this
study with particular interest because of the link i d observed between trauma
and autoimmune disease 
working with senior ifs therapist nancy sowell dr shadick created a
nine month randomized study in which one group of ra patients would receive
both group and individual instruction in ifs while a control group received
regular mailings and phone calls regarding disease symptoms and management 
both groups continued with their regular medications and they were assessed
periodically by rheumatologists who were not informed which group they
belonged to 
the goal of the ifs group was to teach patients how to accept and

understand their inevitable fear hopelessness and anger and to treat those
feelings as members of their own internal family they would learn the inner
dialogue skills that would enable them to recognize their pain identify the
accompanying thoughts and emotions and then approach these internal states
with interest and compassion 
a basic problem emerged early like so many trauma survivors the ra
patients were alexithymic as nancy sowell later told me they never
complained about their pain or disability unless they were totally overwhelmed 
asked how they were feeling they almost always replied i m fine their stoic
parts clearly helped them cope but these managers also kept them in a state of
denial some shut out their bodily sensations and emotions to the extent that they
could not collaborate effectively with their doctors 
to get things moving the leaders introduced the ifs parts dramatically 
rearranging furniture and props to represent managers exiles and firefighters 
over the course of several weeks group members began to talk about the
managers who told them to grin and bear it because no one wanted to hear
about their pain anyway then as they asked the stoic parts to step back they
started to acknowledge the angry part that wanted to yell and wreak havoc the
part that wanted stay in bed all the time and the exile who felt worthless because
she wasn t allowed to talk it emerged that as children nearly all of them were
supposed to be seen and not heard safety meant keeping their needs under
wraps 
individual ifs therapy helped patients apply the language of parts to daily
issues for example one woman felt trapped by conflicts at her job where a
manager part insisted the only way out was to overwork until her ra flared up 
with the therapist s help she realized that she could care for her needs without
making herself sick 
the two groups ifs and controls were evaluated three times during the
nine month study period and then again one year later at the end of nine
months the ifs group showed measurable improvements in self assessed joint
pain physical function self compassion and overall pain relative to the
education group they also showed significant improvements in depression and
self efficacy the ifs group s gains in pain perception and depressive symptoms
were sustained one year later although objective medical tests could no longer
detect measurable improvements in pain or function in other words what had
changed most was the patients ability to live with their disease in their
conclusions shadick and sowell emphasized ifs s focus on self compassion as

a key factor 
this was not the first study to show that psychological interventions can
help ra patients cognitive behavioral therapies and mindfulness based
practices have also been shown to have a positive impact on pain joint
inflammation physical disability and depression

 however none of these
studies has asked a crucial question are increased psychological safety and
comfort reflected in a better functioning immune system 
liberating the exiled child
peter ran an oncology service at a prestigious academic medical center that was
consistently rated as one of the best in the country as he sat in my office in
perfect physical shape because of his regular squash practice his confidence had
crossed the line into arrogance this man certainly did not seem to suffer from
ptsd he told me he just wanted to know how he could help his wife to be less
 touchy she had threatened to leave him unless he did something about what
she termed his callous behavior peter assured me that her perception was
warped because he obviously had no problem being empathic with sick people 
he loved talking about his work proud of the fact that residents and fellows
competed fiercely to be on his service and also of scuttlebutt he d heard about
his staff being terrified of him he described himself as brutally honest a real
scientist someone who just looked at the facts and with a meaningful glance in
my direction did not suffer fools gladly he had high standards but no higher
than he had for himself and he assured me that he didn t need anybody s love 
just their respect 
peter also told me that his psychiatry rotation in med school had convinced
him that psychiatrists still practiced witchcraft and his one stint in couples 
therapy had further confirmed that opinion he expressed contempt for people
who blamed their parents or society for their problems even though he had had
his own share of misery as a child he was determined never to think of himself
as a victim 
while peter s toughness and his love for precision appealed to me i could
not help but wonder if we would discover something i d seen all too often that
internal managers who are obsessed with power are usually created as a bulwark
against feeling helpless 
when i asked him about his family peter told me that his father ran a

manufacturing business he was a holocaust survivor who could be brutal and
exacting but he also had a tender and sentimental side that had kept peter
connected with him and that had inspired peter to become a physician as he
told me about his mother he realized for the first time that she had substituted
rigorous housekeeping for genuine care but peter denied that this bothered him 
he went to school and got straight as he had vowed to build a life free of
rejection and humiliation but ironically he lived with death and rejection every
day death on the oncology ward and the constant struggle to get his research
funded and published 
peter s wife joined us for the next meeting she described how he criticized
her incessantly her taste in clothes her child rearing practices her reading
habits her intelligence her friends he was rarely at home and never
emotionally available because he had so many important obligations and
because he was so explosive his family always tiptoed around him she was
determined to leave him and start a new life unless he made some radical
changes at that point for the first time i saw peter become obviously
distressed he assured me and his wife that he wanted to work things out 
at our next session i asked him to let his body relax close his eyes focus
his attention inside and ask that critical part the one his wife had identified
 
what it was afraid would happen if he stopped his ruthless judging after about
thirty seconds he said he felt stupid talking to himself he didn t want to try
some new age gimmick he d come to me looking for empirically verified
therapy i assured him that like him i was at the forefront of empirically based
therapies and that this was one of them he was silent for perhaps a minute
before he whispered i would get hurt i urged him to ask the critic what that
meant still with his eyes closed peter replied if you criticize others they
don t dare to hurt you then if you are perfect nobody can criticize you i
asked him to thank his critic for protecting him against hurt and humiliation and
as he became silent again i could see his shoulders relax and his breathing
become slower and deeper 
he next told me that he was aware that his pomposity was affecting his
relationships with his colleagues and students he felt lonely and despised during
staff meetings and uncomfortable at hospital parties when i asked him if he
wanted to change the way that angry part threatened people he replied that he
did i then asked him where it was located in his body and he found it in the
middle of his chest keeping his focus inside i asked him how he felt toward it 
he said it made him scared 

next i asked him to stay focused on it and see how he felt toward it now he
said he was curious to know more about it i asked him how old it was he said
about seven i asked him to have his critic show him what he protected after a
lengthy silence still with his eyes closed he told me that he was witnessing a
scene from his childhood his father was beating a little boy him and he was
standing to one side thinking how stupid that kid was to provoke his dad when i
asked him how he felt about the boy who was getting hurt he told me that he
despised him he was a weakling and a whiner after showing even the least bit
of defiance to his dad s high handed ways he inevitably capitulated and
whimpered that he would be a good little boy he had no guts no fire in his
belly i asked the critic if he would be willing to step aside so we could see what
was going on with that boy in response the critic appeared in full force and
called him names like wimp and sissy i asked peter again if the critic would
be willing to step aside and give the boy a chance to speak he shut down
completely and left the session saying that he was unlikely ever to set foot in my
office again 
but the following week he was back as she had threatened his wife had
gone to a lawyer and filed for divorce he was devastated and no longer looked
anything like the perfectly put together doctor whom i d come to know and in
many ways dread faced with the loss of his family he became unhinged and
felt comforted by the idea that if things got too bad he could take his life in his
own hands 
we went inside again and identified the part that was terrified of
abandonment once he was in his mindful self state i urged him to ask that
terrified boy to show him the burdens he was carrying again his first reaction
was disgust at the boy s weakness but after i asked him to get that part to step
back he saw an image of himself as a young boy in his parents house alone in
his room screaming in terror peter watched this scene for several minutes 
weeping silently through much of it i asked him if the boy had told him
everything he wanted him to know no there were other scenes like running to
embrace his father at the door and getting slapped for having disobeyed his
mother 
from time to time he would interrupt the process by explaining why his
parents couldn t have done any better than they had their being holocaust
survivors and all that implied again i suggested he find the protective parts that
were interrupting the witnessing of the boy s pain and request that they move
temporarily to another room and each time he was able to return to his grief 

i asked peter to tell the boy that he now understood how bad the experience
had been he sat in a long sad silence then i asked him to show the boy that he
cared about him after some coaxing he put his arms around the boy i was
surprised that this seemingly harsh and callous man knew exactly how to take
care of him 
then after some time i urged peter to go back into the scene and take the
boy away with him peter imagined himself confronting his dad as a grown man 
telling him if you ever mess with that boy again i ll come and kill you he
then in his imagination took the child to a beautiful campground he knew 
where the boy could play and frolic with ponies while he watched over him 
our work was not done after his wife rescinded her threat of divorce some
of his old habits returned and we had to revisit that isolated boy from time to
time to make sure that peter s wounded parts were taken care of especially
when he felt hurt by something that happened at home or on the job this is the
stage ifs calls unburdening and it corresponds to nursing those exiled parts
back to health with each new unburdening peter s once scathing inner critic
relaxed as little by little it became more like a mentor than a judge and he
began to repair his relationships with his family and colleagues he also stopped
suffering from tension headaches 
one day he told me that he d spent his adulthood trying to let go of his past 
and he remarked how ironic it was that he had to get closer to it in order to let it
go

chapter 18
filling in the holes creating
structures
the greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter
their lives by altering their attitudes of mind 
 william james
it is not that something different is seen but that one sees differently it
is as though the spatial act of seeing were changed by a new dimension 
 carl jung
t is one thing to process memories of trauma but it is an entirely different
matter to confront the inner void the holes in the soul that result from not
having been wanted not having been seen and not having been allowed to speak
the truth if your parents faces never lit up when they looked at you it s hard to
know what it feels like to be loved and cherished if you come from an
incomprehensible world filled with secrecy and fear it s almost impossible to
find the words to express what you have endured if you grew up unwanted and
ignored it is a major challenge to develop a visceral sense of agency and self 
worth 
the research that judy herman chris perry and i had done see chapter 9 
showed that people who felt unwanted as children and those who did not
remember feeling safe with anyone while growing up did not fully benefit from
conventional psychotherapy presumably because they could not activate old

traces of feeling cared for 
i could see this even in some of my most committed and articulate patients 
despite their hard work in therapy and their share of personal and professional
accomplishments they could not erase the devastating imprints of a mother who
was too depressed to notice them or a father who treated them like he wished
they d never been born it was clear that their lives would change fundamentally
only if they could reconstruct those implicit maps but how how can we help
people become viscerally acquainted with feelings that were lacking early in
their lives 
i glimpsed a possible answer when i attended the founding conference of the
united states association for body psychotherapy in june 1994 at a small
college in beverley on the rocky massachusetts coast ironically i had been
asked to represent mainstream psychiatry at the meeting and to speak on using
brain scans to visualize mental states but as soon as i walked into the lobby
where attendees had gathered for morning coffee i realized this was a different
crowd from my usual psychopharmacology or psychotherapy gatherings the
way they talked to one another their postures and gestures radiated vitality and
engagement the sort of physical reciprocity that is the essence of attunement 
i soon struck up a conversation with albert pesso a stocky former dancer
with the martha graham dance company who was then in his early seventies 
underneath his bushy eyebrows he exuded kindness and confidence he told me
that he had found a way of fundamentally changing people s relationship to their
core somatic selves his enthusiasm was infectious but i was skeptical and
asked him if he was certain he could change the settings of the amygdala 
unfazed by the fact that nobody had ever tested his method scientifically he
confidently assured me that he could 
pesso was about to conduct a workshop in pbsp psychomotor therapy 
1
and he invited me to attend it was unlike any group work i had ever seen he
took a low chair opposite a woman named nancy whom he called a
 protagonist with the other participants seated on pillows around them he then
invited nancy to talk about what was troubling her occasionally using her
pauses to witness what he was observing as in a witness can see how
crestfallen you are when you talk about your father deserting the family i was
impressed by how carefully he tracked subtle shifts in body posture facial
expression tone of voice and eye gaze the nonverbal expressions of emotion 
 this is called microtracking in psychomotor therapy 
each time pesso made a witness statement nancy s face and body relaxed

a bit as if she felt comforted by being seen and validated his quiet comments
seemed to bolster her courage to continue and go deeper when nancy started to
cry he observed that nobody should have to bear so much pain all by herself 
and he asked if she would like to choose someone to sit next to her he called
this a contact person nancy nodded and after carefully scanning the room 
pointed to a kind looking middle aged woman pesso asked nancy where she
would like her contact person to sit right here nancy said decisively 
indicating a pillow immediately to her right 
i was fascinated people process spatial relations with the right hemisphere
of the brain and our neuroimaging research had shown that the imprint of
trauma is principally on the right hemisphere as well see chapter 3 caring 
disapproval and indifference all are primarily conveyed by facial expression 
tone of voice and physical movements according to recent research up to 90
percent of human communication occurs in the nonverbal right hemisphere
realm 
2
 and this was where pesso s work seemed primarily to be directed as the
workshop went on i was also struck by how the contact person s presence
seemed to help nancy tolerate the painful experiences she was dredging up 
3
but what was most unusual was how pesso created tableaus or as he called
them structures of the protagonists past as the narratives unfolded group
participants were asked to play the roles of significant people in the protagonists 
lives such as parents and other family members so that their inner world began
to take form in three dimensional space group members were also enlisted to
play the ideal wished for parents who would provide the support love and
protection that had been lacking at critical moments protagonists became the
directors of their own plays creating around them the past they never had and
they clearly experienced profound physical and mental relief after these
imaginary scenarios could this technique instill imprints of safety and comfort
alongside those of terror and abandonment decades after the original shaping of
mind and brain 
intrigued with the promise of pesso s work i eagerly accepted his invitation
to visit his hilltop farmhouse in southern new hampshire after lunch beneath
an ancient oak tree al asked me to join him in his red clapboard barn now a
studio to do a structure i d spent several years in psychoanalysis so i did not
expect any major revelations i was a settled professional man in my forties with
my own family and i thought of my parents as two elderly people who were
trying to create a decent old age for themselves i certainly did not think they
still had a major influence on me 

since there were no other people available for role play al began by asking
me to select an object or a piece of furniture to represent my father i chose a
gigantic black leather couch and asked al to put it upright about eight feet in
front of me slightly to the left then he asked if i d like to bring my mother into
the room as well and i chose a heavy lamp approximately the same height as
the upright couch as the session continued the space became populated with
the important people in my life my best friend a tiny kleenex box to my right 
my wife a small pillow next to him my two children two more tiny pillows 
after a while i surveyed the projection of my internal landscape two
hulking dark and threatening objects representing my parents and an array of
minuscule objects representing my wife children and friends i was astounded i
had re created my inner image of my stern calvinistic parents from the time i
was a little boy my chest felt tight and i m sure that my voice sounded even
tighter i could not deny what my spatial brain was revealing the structure had
allowed me to visualize my implicit map of the world 
when i told al what i had just uncovered he nodded and asked if i would
allow him to change my perspective i felt my skepticism return but i liked al
and was curious about his method so i hesitantly agreed he then interposed his
body directly between me and the couch and lamp making them disappear from
my line of sight instantaneously i felt a deep release in my body the
constriction in my chest eased and my breathing became relaxed that was the
moment i decided to become pesso s student

restructuring inner maps
projecting your inner world into the three dimensional space of a structure
enables you to see what s happening in the theater of your mind and gives you a
much clearer perspective on your reactions to people and events in the past as
you position placeholders for the important people in your life you may be
surprised by the unexpected memories thoughts and emotions that come up 
you then can experiment with moving the pieces around on the external
chessboard that you ve created and see what effect it has on you 
although the structures involve dialogue psychomotor therapy does not
explain or interpret the past instead it allows you to feel what you felt back
then to visualize what you saw and to say what you could not say when it
actually happened it s as if you could go back into the movie of your life and

rewrite the crucial scenes you can direct the role players to do things they failed
to do in the past such as keeping your father from beating up your mom these
tableaus can stimulate powerful emotions for example as you place your real
mother in the corner cowering in terror you may feel a deep longing to protect
her and realize how powerless you felt as a child but if you then create an ideal
mother who stands up to your father and who knows how to avoid getting
trapped in abusive relationships
 
you may experience a visceral sense of relief
and an unburdening of that old guilt and helplessness or you might confront the
brother who brutalized you as a child and then create an ideal brother who
protects you and becomes your role model 
the job of the director
 
therapist and other group members is to provide
protagonists with the support they need to delve into whatever they have been
too afraid to explore on their own the safety of the group allows you to notice
things that you have hidden from yourself usually the things you are most
ashamed of when you no longer have to hide the structure allows you to place
the shame where it belongs on the figures right in front of you who represent
those who hurt you and made you feel helpless as a child 
feeling safe means you can say things to your father or rather the
placeholder who represents him that you wish you could have said as a five 
year old you can tell the placeholder for your depressed and frightened mother
how terrible you felt about not being able to take care of her you can experiment
with distance and proximity and explore what happens as you move placeholders
around as an active participant you can lose yourself in a scene in a way you
cannot when you simply tell a story and as you take charge of representing the
reality of your experience the witness keeps you company reflecting the
changes in your posture facial expression and tone of voice 
in my experience physically reexperiencing the past in the present and then
reworking it in a safe and supportive container can be powerful enough to
create new supplemental memories simulated experiences of growing up in an
attuned affectionate setting where you are protected from harm structures do
not erase bad memories or even neutralize them the way emdr does instead a
structure offers fresh options an alternative memory in which your basic
human needs are met and your longings for love and protection are fulfilled 
revising the past
let me give an example from a workshop i led not long ago at the esalen

institute in big sur california 
maria was a slender athletic filipina in her midforties who had been
pleasant and accommodating during our first two days which had been devoted
to exploring the long term impact of trauma and teaching self regulation
techniques but now seated on her pillow about six feet away from me she
looked scared and collapsed i wondered to myself if she had volunteered as a
protagonist mainly to please the girlfriend who had accompanied her to the
workshop 
i began by encouraging her to notice what was going on inside her and to
share whatever came to mind after a long silence she said i can t really feel
anything in my body and my mind is blank mirroring her inner tension i
replied a witness can see how worried you are that your mind is blank and you
don t feel anything after volunteering to do a structure is that right yes she
answered sounding slightly relieved 
the witness figure enters the structure at the very beginning and takes the
role of an accepting nonjudgmental observer who joins the protagonist by
reflecting his or her emotional state and noting the context in which that state has
emerged as when i mentioned maria s volunteering to do a structure being
validated by feeling heard and seen is a precondition for feeling safe which is
critical when we explore the dangerous territory of trauma and abandonment a
neuroimaging study has shown that when people hear a statement that mirrors
their inner state the right amygdala momentarily lights up as if to underline the
accuracy of the reflection 
i encouraged maria to keep focusing on her breath one of the exercises we
had been practicing together and to notice what she was feeling in her body 
after another long silence she hesitantly began to speak there is always a
sense of fear in everything i do it doesn t look like i am afraid but i am always
pushing myself it is really difficult for me to be up here i reflected a witness
can see how uncomfortable you feel pushing yourself to be here and she
nodded slightly straightening her spine signaling that she felt understood she
continued i grew up thinking that my family was normal but i always was
terrified of my dad i never felt cared for by him he never hit me as hard as he
did my siblings but i have a pervasive sense of fear i noted that a witness
could see how afraid she looked as she spoke of her father and then i invited her
to select a group member to represent him 
maria scanned the room and chose scott a gentle video producer who had
been a lively and supportive member of the group i gave scott his script i

enroll as your real father who terrified you when you were a little girl which
he repeated note that this work is not about improvisation but about accurately
enacting the dialogue and directions provided by the witness and protagonist i
then asked maria where she would like her real father to be positioned and she
instructed scott to stand about twelve feet away slightly to her right and facing
away from her we were beginning to create the tableau and every time i
conduct a structure i m impressed by how precise the outward projections of the
right hemisphere are protagonists always know exactly where the various
characters in their structures should be located 
it also surprises me again and again how the placeholders representing the
significant people in the protagonist s past almost immediately assume a virtual
reality the people who enroll seem to 
become 
the people he or she had to deal
with back then not only to the protagonist but often to the other participants as
well i encouraged maria to take a good long look at her real father and as she
gazed at him standing there we could witness how her emotions shifted between
terror and a deep sense of compassion for him she tearfully reflected on how
difficult his life had been how as a child during world war ii he had seen
people beheaded how he had been forced to eat rotten fish infested with
maggots structures promote one of the essential conditions for deep therapeutic
change a trancelike state in which multiple realities can live side by side past
and present knowing that you re an adult while feeling the way you did as a
child expressing your rage or terror to someone who feels like your abuser while
being fully aware that you are talking to scott who is nothing like your real
father and experiencing simultaneously the complex emotions of loyalty 
tenderness rage and longing that kids feel with their parents 
as maria began to speak about their relationship when she was a little girl i
continued to mirror her expressions her father had brutalized her mother she
said he was relentlessly critical of her diet her body her housekeeping and she
was always afraid for her mother when he berated her maria described her
mother as loving and warm she could not have survived without her she would
always be there to comfort maria after her father lashed out at her but she didn t
do anything to protect her children from their father s rage i think my mom had
a lot of fear herself i have a sense that she didn t protect us because she felt
trapped 
at this point i suggested that it was time to call maria s real mother into the
room maria scanned the group and smiled brightly as she asked kristin a
blonde scandinavian looking artist to play the part of her real mother kristin

accepted in the formal words of the structure i enroll as your real mother who
was warm and loving and without whom you would not have survived but who
failed to protect you from your abusive father maria had her sit on a pillow to
her right much closer than her real father 
i encouraged maria to look at kristin and then i asked so what happens
when you look at her maria angrily said nothing a witness would see
how you stiffen as you look at your real mom and angrily say that you feel
nothing i noted after a long silence i asked again so what happens now 
maria looked slightly more collapsed and repeated nothing i asked her is
there something you want to say to your mom finally maria said i know you
did the best you could and then moments later i wanted you to protect me 
when she began to cry softly i asked her what is happening inside holding
my chest my heart feels like it is pounding really hard maria said my
sadness goes out to my mom how incapable she was of standing up to my father
and protecting us she just shuts down pretending everything s okay and in her
mind it probably is and that makes me mad today i want to say to her mom 
when i see you react to dad when he is being mean when i see your face you
look disgusted and i don t know why you don t say fuck off you don t know
how to fight you are such a pushover there is a part of you that is not good
and not alive i don t even know what i want you to say i just want you to be
different nothing you do is right like you accept everything when it is totally
not okay i noted a witness would see how fierce you are as you want your
mother to stand up to your dad maria then talked about how she wanted her
mother to run off with the kids and take them away from her terrifying father 
i then suggested enrolling another group member to represent her ideal
mother maria scanned the room again and chose ellen a therapist and martial
artist maria placed her on a pillow to her right between her real mother and
herself and asked ellen to put her arm around her what do you want your ideal
mother to say to your dad i asked i want her to say if you are going to talk
like that i am going to leave you and take the kids she answered we are not
going to sit here and listen to this shit ellen repeated maria s words then i
asked what happens now maria responded i like it i have a little pressure
in my head my breath is free i have a subtle energetic dance in my body now 
sweet a witness can see how delighted you are when you hear your mother
saying that she is not taking this shit from your dad anymore and that she will
take you away from him i told her maria began to sob and said i would have
been able to be a safe happy little girl out of the corner of my eye i could see

several group members weeping silently the possibility of growing up safe and
happy clearly resonated with their own longings 
after a while i suggested that it was time to summon maria s ideal father i
could clearly see the delight in maria s eyes as she scanned the group imagining
her ideal father she finally chose danny i gave him his script and he gently
told her i enroll as your ideal father who would have loved you and cared for
you and who would not have terrified you maria instructed him to take a seat
near her on her left and beamed my healthy mom and dad she exclaimed i
responded allow yourself to feel that joy as you look at an ideal dad who
would have cared for you maria cried it s beautiful and threw her arms
around danny smiling at him through her tears i am remembering a really
tender moment with my dad and that is what this feels like i would love to have
my mom next to me too both ideal parents tenderly responded and cradled her 
i left them there for a while so that they could fully internalize the experience 
we finished with danny saying if i had been your ideal dad back then i
would have loved you just like this and not have inflicted my cruelty while
ellen added if i had been your ideal mom i would have stood up for you and
me and protected you and not let any harm come to you all the characters then
made final statements deenrolling from the roles they had played and formally
resumed being themselves 
rescripting your life
nobody grows up under ideal circumstances as if we even know what ideal
circumstances are as my late friend david servan schreiber once said every
life is difficult in its own way but we do know that in order to become self 
confident and capable adults it helps enormously to have grown up with steady
and predictable parents parents who delighted in you in your discoveries and
explorations parents who helped you organize your comings and goings and
who served as role models for self care and getting along with other people 
defects in any of these areas are likely to manifest themselves later in life a
child who has been ignored or chronically humiliated is likely to lack self 
respect children who have not been allowed to assert themselves will probably
have difficulty standing up for themselves as adults and most grown ups who
were brutalized as children carry a smoldering rage that will take a great deal of
energy to contain 
our relationships will suffer as well the more early pain and deprivation

we have experienced the more likely we are to interpret other people s actions
as being directed against us and the less understanding we will be of their
struggles insecurities and concerns if we cannot appreciate the complexity of
their lives we may see anything they do as a confirmation that we are going to
get hurt and disappointed 
in the chapters on the biology of trauma we saw how trauma and
abandonment disconnect people from their body as a source of pleasure and
comfort or even as a part of themselves that needs care and nurturance when
we cannot rely on our body to signal safety or warning and instead feel
chronically overwhelmed by physical stirrings we lose the capacity to feel at
home in our own skin and by extension in the world as long as their map of
the world is based on trauma abuse and neglect people are likely to seek
shortcuts to oblivion anticipating rejection ridicule and deprivation they are
reluctant to try out new options certain that these will lead to failure this lack
of experimentation traps people in a matrix of fear isolation and scarcity where
it is impossible to welcome the very experiences that might change their basic
worldview 
this is one reason the highly structured experiences of psychomotor therapy
are so valuable participants can safely project their inner reality into a space
filled with real people where they can explore the cacophony and confusion of
the past this leads to concrete aha moments yes that is what it was like that
is what i had to deal with and that is what it would have felt like back then if i
had been cherished and cradled acquiring a sensory experience of feeling
treasured and protected as a three year old in the trancelike container of a
structure allows people to rescript their inner experience as in i can
spontaneously interact with other people without having to be afraid of being
rejected or getting hurt 
structures harness the extraordinary power of the imagination to transform
the inner narratives that drive and confine our functioning in the world with the
proper support the secrets that once were too dangerous to be revealed can be
disclosed not just to a therapist a latter day father confessor but in our
imagination to the people who actually hurt and betrayed us 
the three dimensional nature of the structure transforms the hidden the
forbidden and the feared into visible concrete reality in this it is somewhat
similar to ifs which we explored in the previous chapter ifs calls forth the
split off parts that you created in order to survive and enables you to identify and
talk with them so that your undamaged self can emerge in contrast a structure

creates a three dimensional image of whom and what you had to deal with and
gives you a chance to create a different outcome 
most people are hesitant to go into past pain and disappointment it only
promises to bring back the intolerable but as they are mirrored and witnessed a
new reality begins to take shape accurate mirroring feels completely different
from being ignored criticized and put down it gives you permission to feel
what you feel and know what you know
 
one of the essential foundations of
recovery 
trauma causes people to remain stuck in interpreting the present in light of
an unchanging past the scene you re create in a structure may or may not be
precisely what happened but it represents the structure of your inner world your
internal map and the hidden rules that you have been living by 
daring to tell the truth
i recently led another group structure with a twenty six year old man named
mark who at age thirteen had accidentally overheard his father having phone
sex with his aunt his mother s sister mark felt confused embarrassed hurt 
betrayed and paralyzed by this knowledge but when he tried to talk with his
father about it he was met with rage and denial he was told that he had a filthy
imagination and accused of trying to break up the family mark never dared to
tell his mom but henceforth the family secrets and hypocrisy contaminated
every aspect of his home life and gave him a pervasive sense that nobody could
be trusted after school he spent his isolated adolescence hanging around
neighborhood basketball courts or in his room watching tv when he was
twenty one his mother died of a broken heart mark says and his father
married the aunt mark was not invited to either the funeral or the wedding 
secrets like these become inner toxins realities that you are not allowed to
acknowledge to yourself or to others but that nevertheless become the template
of your life i knew none of this history when mark joined the group but he
stood out by his emotional distance and during check ins he acknowledged that
he felt separated from everyone by a dense fog i was quite worried about what
would be revealed once we started to look behind his frozen expressionless
exterior 
when i invited mark to talk about his family he said a few words and then
seemed to shut down even more so i encouraged him to ask for a contact
figure to support him he chose a white haired group member richard and

placed richard on a pillow next to him touching his shoulder then as he began
to tell his story mark placed joe as his real father ten feet in front of him and
directed carolyn representing his mother to crouch in a corner with her face
hidden mark next asked amanda to play his aunt telling her to stand defiantly
to one side arms crossed over her chest representing all the calculating 
ruthless and devious women who are after men 
surveying the tableau he had created mark sat up straight eyes wide open 
clearly the fog had lifted i said a witness can see how startled you are seeing
what you had to deal with mark nodded appreciatively and remained silent and
somber for some time then looking at his father he burst out you asshole 
you hypocrite you ruined my life i invited mark to tell his father all the
things that he had wanted to tell him but never could a long list of accusations
followed i directed the father to respond physically as if he had been punched 
so that mark could see that that his blows had landed it did not surprise me
when mark spontaneously said that he d always worried that his rage would get
out of control and that this fear had kept him from standing up for himself in
school at work and in other relationships 
after mark had confronted his father i asked if he would like richard to
assume a new role that of his ideal father i instructed richard to look mark
directly in the eye and to say if i had been your ideal father back then i would
have listened to you and not accused you of having a filthy imagination when
richard repeated this mark started to tremble oh my god life would have
been so different if i could have trusted my father and talked about what was
going on i could have 
had
 a father i then told richard to say if i had been
your ideal father back then i would have welcomed your anger and you would
have had a father you could have trusted mark visibly relaxed and said that
would have made all the difference in the world 
then mark addressed the standin for his aunt the group was visibly
stunned as he unleashed a torrent of abuse on her you conniving whore you
backstabber you betrayed your sister and ruined her life you ruined our
family after he was done mark started to sob he then said he d always been
deeply suspicious of any woman who showed an interest in him the remainder
of the structure took another half hour in which we slowly set up conditions for
him to create two new women the ideal aunt who did not betray her sister but
who helped support their isolated immigrant family and the ideal mother who
kept her husband s interest and devotion and so did not die of heartbreak mark
ended the structure quietly surveying the scene he had created with a contented

smile on his face 
for the remainder of the workshop mark was an open and valuable member
of the group and three months later he sent me an e mail saying that this
experience had changed his life he had recently moved in with his first
girlfriend and although they d had some heated discussions about their new
arrangement he d been able to take in her point of view without clamming up
defensively going back to his fear or rage or feeling that she was trying to pull a
fast one he was amazed that he felt okay disagreeing with her and that he was
able to stand up for himself he then asked for the name of a therapist in his
community to help with the huge changes he was making in his life and i
fortunately had a colleague i could refer him to 
antidotes to painful memories
like the model mugging classes that i discussed in chapter 13 the structures in
psychomotor therapy hold out the possibility of forming virtual memories that
live side by side with the painful realities of the past and provide sensory
experiences of feeling seen cradled and supported that can serve as antidotes to
memories of hurt and betrayal in order to change people need to become
viscerally familiar with realities that directly contradict the static feelings of the
frozen or panicked self of trauma replacing them with sensations rooted in
safety mastery delight and connection as we saw in the chapter on emdr 
one of the functions of dreaming is to create associations in which the frustrating
events of the day are interwoven with the rest of one s life
 
unlike our dreams 
psychomotor structures are still subject to the laws of physics but they too can
reweave the past 
of course we can never undo what happened but we can create new
emotional scenarios intense and real enough to defuse and counter some of those
old ones the healing tableaus of structures offer an experience that many
participants have never believed was possible for them to be welcomed into a
world where people delight in them protect them meet their needs and make
you feel at home

rewiring the brain 
neurofeedback
is it a fact or have i dreamt it that by means of electricity the world
of matter has become a great nerve vibrating thousands of miles in a
breathless point of time

and over again is the very root of the judgment character and will 
 william james
he summer after my first year of medical school i worked as a part time
research assistant in ernest hartmann s sleep laboratory at boston state
hospital my job was to prepare and monitor the study participants and to
analyze their eeg electroencephalogram or brain wave tracings subjects
would show up in the evening i would paste an array of wires onto their scalps
and another set of electrodes around their eyes to register the rapid eye
movements that occur during dreaming then i would walk them to their
bedrooms bid them good night and start the polygraph a bulky machine with
thirty two pens that transmitted their brain activity onto a continuous spool of
paper 
even though our subjects were fast asleep the neurons in their brains kept
up their frenzied internal communication which was transmitted to the

polygraph throughout the night i d settle down to pore over the previous night s
eegs stopping from time to time to pick up baseball scores on my radio and
use the intercom to wake subjects whenever the polygraph showed a rem sleep
cycle i would ask what they had dreamed about and write down what they
reported and then in the morning help them fill out a questionnaire about sleep
quality and send them on their way 
those quiet nights at hartmann s lab documented a great deal about rem
sleep and contributed to building the basic understanding of sleep processes 
which paved the way for the crucial discoveries that i discussed in chapter 15 
however until recently the long standing hope that the eeg would help us
better understand how electrical brain activity contributes to psychiatric
problems remained largely unrealized 
mapping the electrical circuits of the brain
before the advent of the pharmacological revolution it was widely understood
that brain activity depends on both chemical and electrical signals the
subsequent dominance of pharmacology almost obliterated interest in the
electrophysiology of the brain for several decades 
the first recording of the brain s electrical activity was made in 1924 by the
german psychiatrist hans berger this new technology was initially met with
skepticism and ridicule by the medical establishment but
electroencephalography gradually became an indispensable tool for diagnosing
seizure activity in patients with epilepsy berger discovered that different
brainwave patterns reflected different mental activities for example trying to
solve a math problem resulted in bursts at a moderately fast frequency band
known as beta he hoped that eventually science would be able to correlate
different psychiatric problems with specific eeg irregularities this expectation
was fueled by the first reports on eeg patterns in behavior problem children 
in 1938 
1
 most of these hyperactive and impulsive children had slower than 
normal waves in their frontal lobes this finding has been reproduced
innumerable times since then and in 2013 slow wave prefrontal activity was
certified by the food and drug administration as a biomarker for adhd slow
frontal lobe electrical activity explains why these kids have poor executive
functioning their rational brains lack proper control over their emotional brains 
which also occurs when abuse and trauma have made the emotional centers

hyperalert to danger and organized for fight or flight 
early in my career i also hoped that the eeg might help us to make better
diagnoses and between 1980 and 1990 i sent many of my patients to get eegs
to determine if their emotional instability was rooted in neurological
abnormalities the reports usually came back with the phrase nonspecific
temporal lobe abnormalities 
2
 this told me very little and because at that time
the only way we could change these ambiguous patterns was with drugs that had
more side effects than benefits i gave up doing routine eegs on my patients 
then in 2000 a study by my friend alexander mcfarlane and his associates
 researchers in adelaide australia rekindled my interest as it documented clear
differences in information processing between traumatized subjects and a group
of normal australians the researchers used a standardized test called the
oddball paradigm in which subjects are asked to detect the item that doesn t fit
in a series of otherwise related images like a trumpet in a group of tables and
chairs none of the images was related to trauma 
normal versus ptsd 
 patterns of attention milliseconds after the brain is presented with input it
starts organizing the meaning of the incoming information normally all regions of the brain
collaborate in a synchronized pattern left while the brainwaves in ptsd are less well coordinated 
the brain has trouble filtering out irrelevant information and has problems attending to the stimulus at
hand 
in the normal group key parts of the brain worked together to produce a
coherent pattern of filtering focus and analysis see left image below in
contrast the brain waves of traumatized subjects were more loosely coordinated
and failed to come together into a coherent pattern specifically they did not
generate the brainwave pattern that helps people pay attention on the task at
hand by filtering out irrelevant information the upward curve labeled n200 in
addition the core information processing configuration of the brain the
downward peak p300 was poorly defined the depth of the wave determines
how well we are able to take in and analyze new data this was important new
information about how traumatized people process nontraumatic information

that has profound implications for understanding day to day information
processing these brainwave patterns could explain why so many traumatized
people have trouble learning from experience and fully engaging in their daily
lives their brains are not organized to pay careful attention to what is going on
in the present moment 
sandy mcfarlane s study reminded me of what pierre janet had said back in
1889 traumatic stress is an illness of not being able to be fully alive in the
present years later when i saw the movie 
the hurt locker
 which dealt with
the experiences of soldiers in iraq i immediately recalled sandy s study as
long as they were coping with extreme stress these men performed with
pinpoint focus but back in civilian life they were overwhelmed having to make
simple choices in a supermarket we are now seeing alarming statistics about the
number of returning combat veterans who enroll in college on the gi bill but do
not complete their degrees some estimates are over 80 percent their well 
documented problems with focusing and attention are surely contributing to
these poor results 
mcfarlane s study clarified a possible mechanism for the lack of focus and
attention in ptsd but it also presented a whole new challenge was there any
way to change these dysfunctional brainwave patterns it was seven years before
i learned that there might be ways to do that 
in 2007 i met sebern fisher at a conference on attachment disordered
children sebern was the former clinical director of a residential treatment center
for severely disturbed adolescents and she told me that she d been using
neurofeedback in her private practice for about ten years she showed me
before and after drawings made by a ten year old this boy had had such severe
temper tantrums learning disabilities and overall difficulties with self 
organization that he could not be handled in school 
3
his first family portrait on the left opposite drawn before treatment
started was at the developmental level of a three year old less than five weeks
later after twenty sessions of neurofeedback his tantrums had decreased and his
drawing showed a marked improvement in complexity ten weeks and another
twenty sessions later his drawing took another leap in complexity and his
behavior normalized 
i had never come across a treatment that could produce such a dramatic
change in mental functioning in so brief a period of time so when sebern
offered to give me a neurofeedback demonstration i eagerly accepted 

seeing the symphony of the brain
at sebern s office in northampton massachusetts she showed me her
neurofeedback equipment two desktop computers and a small amplifier and
some of the data she had collected she then pasted one electrode on each side of
my skull and another on my right ear soon the computer in front of me was
displaying rows of brain waves like the ones i d seen on the sleep lab polygraph
three decades earlier sebern s tiny laptop could detect record and display the
electrical symphony of my brain faster and more precisely than what had
probably been a million dollars worth of equipment in hartmann s lab 

from stick figures to clearly defined human beings 
 after four months of neurofeedback a ten 
year old boy s family drawings show the equivalent of six years of mental development 
as sebern explained feedback provides the brain with a mirror of its own
function the oscillations and rhythms that underpin the currents and
crosscurrents of the mind neurofeedback nudges the brain to make more of
some frequencies and less of others creating new patterns that enhance its
natural complexity and its bias toward self regulation 
4
 in effect she told me 
 we may be freeing up innate but stuck oscillatory properties in the brain and
allowing new ones to develop 

sebern adjusted some settings to set the reward and inhibit frequencies 
as she explained so that the feedback would reinforce selected brainwave
patterns while discouraging others now i was looking at something like a video
game featuring three spaceships of different colors the computer was emitting
irregular tones and the spaceships were moving quite randomly i discovered
that when i blinked my eyes they stopped and when i calmly stared at the screen
they moved in tandem accompanied by regular beeps sebern then encouraged
me to make the green spaceship move ahead of the others
 
i leaned forward to
concentrate but the harder i tried the more the green spaceship fell behind she
smiled and told me that i d do much better if i d just relax and let my brain take
in the feedback that the computer was generating so i sat back and after a while
the tones grew steadier and the green spaceship started pulling ahead of the
others i felt calm and focused and my spaceship was winning 
in some ways neurofeedback is similar to watching someone s face during a
conversation if you see smiles or slight nods you re rewarded and you go on
telling your story or making your point but the moment your conversation
partner looks bored or shifts her gaze you ll start to wrap up or change the topic 
in neurofeedback the reward is a tone or movement on the screen instead of a
smile and the inhibition is far more neutral than a frown it s simply an
undesired pattern 
next sebern introduced another feature of neurofeedback its ability to track
circuitry in specific parts of the brain she moved the electrodes from my
temples to my left brow and i started to feel sharp and focused she told me she
was rewarding beta waves in my frontal cortex which accounted for my
alertness when she moved the electrodes to the crown of my head i felt more
detached from the computer images and more aware of the sensations in my
body afterward she showed me a summary graph that recorded how my brain
waves had changed as i experienced subtle shifts in my mental state and physical
sensations 
how could neurofeedback be used to help to treat trauma as sebern
explained with neurofeedback we hope to intervene in the circuitry that
promotes and sustains states of fear and traits of fearfulness shame and rage it
is the repetitive firing of these circuits that defines trauma patients need help to
change the habitual brain patterns created by trauma and its aftermath when the
fear patterns relax the brain becomes less susceptible to automatic stress
reactions and better able to focus on ordinary events after all stress is not an
inherent property of events themselves it is a function of how we label and

react to them neurofeedback simply stabilizes the brain and increases resiliency 
allowing us to develop more choices in how to respond 
the birth of neurofeedback
neurofeedback was not a new technology in 2007 as early as the late 1950s
university of chicago psychology professor joe kamiya who was studying the
phenomenon of internal perception had discovered that people could learn
through feedback to tell when they were producing alpha waves which are
associated with relaxation it took some subjects only four days to reach 100
percent accuracy he then demonstrated that they could also enter voluntarily
into an alpha state in response to a simple sound cue 
in 1968 an article about kamiya s work was published in the popular
magazine 
psychology today
 and the idea that alpha training could relieve stress
and stress related conditions became widely known 
5
 the first scientific work
showing that neurofeedback could have an effect on pathological conditions was
done by barry sterman at ucla the national aeronautics and space
administration had asked sterman to study the toxicity of a rocket fuel 
monomethylhydrazine mmh which was known to cause hallucinations 
nausea and seizures sterman had previously trained some cats to produce a
specific eeg frequency known as the sensorimotor rhythm in cats this alert 
focused state is associated with waiting to be fed he discovered that while his
ordinary lab cats developed seizures after exposure to mmh the cats that had
received neurofeedback did not the training had somehow stabilized their
brains 
in 1971 sterman attached his first human subject twenty three year old
mary fairbanks to a neurofeedback device she had suffered from epilepsy
since the age of eight with grand mal seizures two or more times a month she
trained for an hour a day twice a week at the end of three months she was
virtually seizure free sterman subsequently received a grant from the national
institutes of health to conduct a more systematic study and the impressive
results were published in the journal 
epilepsia
 in 1978 
6
this period of experimentation and huge optimism about the potential of the
human mind came to an end in the middle 1970s with newly discovered
psychiatric drugs psychiatry and brain science adopted a chemical model of
mind and brain and other treatment approaches were relegated to the back

burner 
since then the field of neurofeedback has grown by fits and starts with
much of the scientific groundwork being done in europe russia and australia 
even though there are about ten thousand neurofeedback practitioners in the
united states the practice has not been able to garner the research funding
necessary to gain widespread acceptance one reason may be that there are
multiple competing neurofeedback systems another is that the commercial
potential is limited only a few applications are covered by insurance which
makes neurofeedback expensive for consumers and prevents practitioners from
amassing the resources necessary to do large scale studies 
from a homeless shelter to the nursing station
sebern had arranged for me to speak with three of her patients all told
remarkable stories but as i listened to twenty seven year old lisa who was
studying nursing at a nearby college i felt myself truly awakening to the
stunning potential of this treatment lisa possessed the greatest single resilience
factor humans can have she was an appealing person engaging curious and
obviously intelligent she made great eye contact and she was eager to share
what she had learned about herself best of all like so many survivors i ve
known she had a wry sense of humor and a delicious take on human folly 
based on what i knew about her background it was a miracle that she was
so calm and self possessed she had spent years in group homes and mental
hospitals and she was a familiar presence in the emergency rooms of western
massachusetts the girl who regularly arrived by ambulance half dead from
prescription drug overdoses or bloody from self inflicted wounds 
here is how she began her story i used to envy the kids who knew what
would happen when their parents got drunk at least they could predict the
havoc in my home there was no pattern anything could set my mother off 
eating dinner watching tv coming home from school getting dressed and i
never knew what she was going to do or how she would hurt me it was so
random 
her father had abandoned the family when lisa was three years old leaving
her at the mercy of her psychotic mother torture is not too strong a word to
describe the abuse she endured i lived up in the attic room she told me and
there was another room up there where i would go and piss on the carpet
because i was too scared to go downstairs to the bathroom i would take all the

clothes off my dolls and drive pencils into them and put them up in my window 
when she was twelve years old lisa ran away from home and was picked
up by the police and returned after she ran away again child protective services
stepped in and she spent the next six years in mental hospitals shelters group
homes foster families and on the street no placement lasted because lisa was
so dissociated and self destructive that she terrified her caretakers she would
attack herself or destroy furniture and afterward she would not remember what
she had done which earned her a reputation as a manipulative liar in retrospect 
lisa told me she simply lacked the language to communicate what was going on
with her 
when she turned eighteen she matured out of child protective services
and started an independent life one without family education money or skills 
but shortly after discharge she ran into sebern who had just acquired her first
neurofeedback equipment and remembered lisa from the residential treatment
center where she had once worked she d always had a soft spot for this lost girl 
and she invited lisa to try out her new gizmo 
as sebern recalled when lisa first came to see me it was fall she walked
around with a vacant stare carrying a pumpkin wherever she went there just
wasn t a there there i wasn t ever sure that i had gotten to any organizing self 
any form of talk therapy was impossible for lisa whenever sebern asked her
about anything stressful she would shut down or go into a panic in lisa s
words every time we tried to talk about what had happened to me growing up 
i would have a breakdown i would wake up with cuts and burns and i wouldn t
be able to eat i wouldn t be able to sleep 
her sense of terror was omnipresent i was afraid all the time i didn t like
to be touched i was always jumpy and nervous i couldn t close my eyes if
another person was around there was no convincing me that someone wasn t
going to kick me the second i closed my eyes that makes you feel crazy you
know you re in a room with someone you trust you know intellectually that
nothing s going to happen to you but then there s the rest of your body and you
can t ever relax if someone put their arm around me i would just check out 
she was stuck in a state of inescapable shock 
lisa recalled dissociating when she was a little girl but things got worse
after puberty i started waking up with cuts and people at school would know
me by different names i couldn t have a steady boyfriend because i would date
other guys when i was dissociated and then not remember
 
 i was blacking out a
lot and opening my eyes into some pretty strange situations like many

severely traumatized people lisa could not recognize herself in a mirror 
7
 i had
never heard anyone describe so articulately what it was like to lack a continuous
sense of self 
there was no one to confirm her reality when i was seventeen and living
in the group home for severely disturbed adolescents i cut myself up really
badly with the lid of a tin can they took me to the emergency room but i
couldn t tell the doctor what i had done to cut myself i didn t have any
memory of it the er doctor was convinced that dissociative identity disorder
didn t exist a lot of people involved in mental health tell you it doesn t
exist not that you don t have it but that it doesn t exist 
the first thing lisa did after she aged out of her residential treatment
program was to go off her medications
 
 this doesn t work for everybody she
acknowledged but it turned out to be personally the right choice i know people
who need meds but that was not the case for me after going off them and
starting neurofeedback i became much clearer 
when she invited lisa to do neurofeedback sebern had little idea what to
expect as lisa would be the first dissociative patient she tried it on they met
twice a week and started by rewarding more coherent brain patterns in the right
temporal lobe the fear center of the brain after a few weeks lisa noticed she
was wasn t as uptight around people and she no longer dreaded the basement
laundry room in her building then came a bigger breakthrough she stopped
dissociating i d always had a constant hum of low level conversations in my
head she recalled i was scared i was schizophrenic after half a year of
neurofeedback i stopped hearing those noises i integrated i guess everything
just came together 
as lisa developed a more continuous sense of self she became able to talk
about her experiences i now can actually talk about things like my childhood 
for the first time i started being able to 
do
 therapy up till then i didn t have
enough distance and i couldn t calm down enough if you re still in it it s hard
to talk about it i wasn t able to attach in the way that you need to attach and
open up in the way that you need to open up in order to have any type of
relationship with a therapist this was a stunning revelation so many patients
are in and out of treatment unable to meaningfully connect because they are still
 in it of course when people don t know who they are they can t possibly see
the reality of the people around them 
lisa went on there was so much anxiety around attachment i would go
into a room and try to memorize every possible way to get out every detail

about a person i was trying desperately to keep track of everything that could
hurt me now i know people in a different way it s not based on memorizing
them out of fear when you re not afraid of being hurt you can know people
differently 
this articulate young woman had emerged from the depths of despair and
confusion with a degree of clarity and focus i had never seen before it was clear
that we had to explore the potential of neurofeedback at the trauma center 
getting started in neurofeedback
first we had to decide which of five different existing neurofeedback systems to
adopt and then find a long weekend to learn the principles and practice on one
another 
8
 eight staff members and three trainers volunteered their time to explore
the complexities of eegs electrodes and computer generated feedback on the
second morning of the training when i was partnered with my colleague
michael i placed an electrode on the right side of his head directly over the
sensorimotor strip of his brain and rewarded the frequency of eleven to fourteen
hertz shortly after the session ended michael asked for the attention of the
group he d just had a remarkable experience he told us he had always felt
somewhat on edge and unsafe in the presence of other people even colleagues
like us although nobody seemed to notice he was after all a well respected
therapist he lived with a chronic gnawing sense of danger that feeling was
now gone and he felt safe relaxed and open over the next three years michael
emerged from his habitual low profile to challenge the group with his insights
and opinions and he became one of the most valuable contributors to our
neurofeedback program 
with the help of the ans foundation we started our first study with a group
of seventeen patients who had not responded to previous treatments we targeted
the right temporal area of the brain the location that our early brain scan studies
 described in chapter 3 
9
 had shown to be excessively activated during traumatic
stress and gave them twenty neurofeedback sessions over ten weeks 
because most of these patients suffered from alexithymia it was not easy
for them to report their response to the treatments but their actions spoke for
them they consistently showed up on time for their appointments even if they
had to drive through snowstorms none of them dropped out and at the end of
the full twenty sessions we could document significant improvements not only

in their ptsd scores 
10
 but also in their interpersonal comfort emotional
balance and self awareness 
11
 they were less frantic they slept better and they
felt calmer and more focused 
in any case self reports can be unreliable objective changes in behavior are
much better indicators of how well treatment works the first patient i treated
with neurofeedback was a good example he was a professional man in his early
fifties who defined himself as heterosexual but he compulsively sought
homosexual contact with strangers whenever he felt abandoned and
misunderstood his marriage had broken up around this issue and he had
become hiv positive he was desperate to gain control over his behavior during
a previous therapy he had talked extensively about his sexual abuse by an uncle
at around the age of eight we assumed that his compulsion was related to that
abuse but making that connection had made no difference in his behavior after
more than a year of regular psychotherapy with a competent therapist nothing
had changed 
a week after i started to train his brain to produce slower waves in his right
temporal lobe he had a distressing argument with a new girlfriend and instead
of going to his habitual cruising spot to find sex he decided to go fishing i
attributed that response to chance however over the next ten weeks in the
midst of his tumultuous relationship he continued to find solace in fishing and
began to renovate a lakeside cabin when we skipped three weeks of
neurofeedback because of our vacations schedules his compulsion suddenly
returned suggesting that his brain had not yet stabilized its new pattern we
trained for six more months and now four years later i see him about every six
months for a checkup he has felt no further impulse to engage in his dangerous
sexual activities 
how did his brain come to derive comfort from fishing rather than from
compulsive sexual behavior at this point we simply don t know 
neurofeedback changes brain connectivity patterns the mind follows by
creating new patterns of engagement 
brainwave basics from slow to fast
each line on an eeg charts the activity in a different part of the brain a mixture
of different rhythms ranged on a scale from slow to fast 
12
 the eeg consists of
measurements of varying heights amplitude and wavelengths frequency 

frequency refers to the number of times a waveform rises and falls in one
second and it is measured in hertz hz or cycles per second cps every
frequency on the eeg is relevant to understanding and treating trauma and the
basics are relatively easy to grasp 
delta waves the slowest frequencies 2 5 hz are seen most often during
sleep the brain is in an idling state and the mind is turned inward if people
have too much slow wave activity while they re awake their thinking is foggy
and they exhibit poor judgment and poor impulse control eighty percent of
children with adhd and many individuals diagnosed with ptsd have
excessive slow waves in their frontal lobes 
the electroencephalogram eeg 
 while there is no typical signature for ptsd many traumatized
people have sharply increased activity in the temporal lobes as this patient does t
3
 t

neurofeedback can normalize these abnormal brain patterns and thereby increase emotional stability 
the rate of brainwave firing is related to our
state of arousal

dreaming speeds up brain waves theta frequencies 5 8 hz predominate at the
edge of sleep as in the floating hypnopompic state i described in chapter 15
on emdr they are also characteristic of hypnotic trance states theta waves
create a frame of mind unconstrained by logic or by the ordinary demands of life
and thus open the potential for making novel connections and associations one
of the most promising eeg neurofeedback treatments for ptsd alpha theta
training makes use of that quality to loosen frozen associations and facilitate
new learning on the downside theta frequencies also occur when we re out of
it or depressed 
alpha waves 8 12 hz are accompanied by a sense of peace and calm 
13
they are familiar to anyone who has learned mindfulness meditation
 
 a patient
once told me that neurofeedback worked for him like meditation on steroids i
use alpha training most often in my practice to help people who are either too
numb or too agitated to achieve a state of focused relaxation walter reed
national military medical center recently introduced alpha training instruments
to treat soldiers with ptsd but at the time of this writing the results are not yet
available 
beta waves are the fastest frequencies 13 20 hz when they dominate the
brain is oriented to the outside world beta enables us to engage in focused
attention while performing a task however high beta over 20 hz is associated
with agitation anxiety and body tenseness in effect we are constantly
scanning the environment for danger 
helping the brain to focus

neurofeedback training can improve creativity athletic control and inner
awareness even in people who already are highly accomplished 
14
 when we
started to study neurofeedback we discovered that sports medicine was the only
department in boston university that had any familiarity with the subject one
of my earliest teachers in brain physiology was the sports psychologist len
zaichkowsky who soon left boston to train the vancouver canucks with
neurofeedback 
15
neurofeedback has probably been studied more thoroughly for performance
enhancement than for psychiatric problems in italy the trainer for the soccer
club ac milan used it to help players remain relaxed and focused as they
watched videos of their errors their increased mental and physiological control
paid off when several players joined the italian team that won the 2006 world
cup and when ac milan won the european championship the following
year 
16
 neurofeedback was also included in the science and technology
component of own the podium a 117 million five year plan engineered to
help canada dominate the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver the canadians
won the most gold medals and came in third overall 
musical performance has been shown to benefit as well a panel of judges
from britain s royal college of music found that students who were trained
with ten sessions of neurofeedback by john gruzelier of the university of
london had a 10 percent improvement in the performance of a piece of music 
compared with students who had not received neurofeedback this represents a
huge difference in such a competitive field 
17
given its enhancement of focus attention and concentration it s not
surprising that neurofeedback drew the attention of specialists in attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd at least thirty six studies have shown
that neurofeedback can be an effective and time limited treatment for adhd 
one that s about as effective as conventional drugs 
18
 once the brain has been
trained to produce different patterns of electrical communication no further
treatment is necessary in contrast to drugs which do not change fundamental
brain activity and work only as long as the patient keeps taking them 
where is the problem in my brain 
sophisticated computerized eeg analysis known as the quantitative eeg
 qeeg can trace brainwave activity millisecond by millisecond and its

software can convert that activity into a color map that shows which frequencies
are highest or lowest in key areas of the brain 
19
 the qeeg can also show how
well brain regions are communicating or working together several large qeeg
databases of both normal and abnormal patterns are available which allows us to
compare a patient s qeeg with those of thousands of other people with similar
issues last but not least in contrast to fmris and related scans the qeeg is
both relatively inexpensive and portable 
the qeeg provides compelling evidence of the arbitrary boundaries of
current dsm diagnostic categories dsm labels for mental illness are not
aligned with specific patterns of brain activation mental states that are common
to many diagnoses such as confusion agitation or feeling disembodied are
associated with specific patterns on the qeeg in general the more problems a
patient has the more abnormalities show up in the qeeg 
20
our patients find it very helpful to be able to see the patterns of localized
electrical activity in their brains we can show them the patterns that seem to be
responsible for their difficulty focusing or for their lack of emotional control 
they can see why different brain areas need to be trained to generate different
frequencies and communication patterns these explanations help them shift
from self blaming attempts to control their behavior to learning to process
information differently 
as ed hamlin who trained us in interpreting the qeeg recently wrote to
me many people respond to the training but the ones that respond best and
quickest are those that can see how the feedback is related to something they are
doing for example if i m attempting to help someone increase their ability to
be present we can see how they re doing with it then the benefit really begins
to accumulate there is something very empowering about having the
experience of changing your brain s activity with your mind 
how does trauma change brain waves 
in our neurofeedback lab we see individuals with long histories of traumatic
stress who have only partially responded to existing treatments their qeegs
show a variety of different patterns often there is excessive activity in the right
temporal lobe the fear center of the brain combined with too much frontal slow 
wave activity this means that their hyperaroused emotional brains dominate
their mental life our research showed that calming the fear center decreases

trauma based problems and improves executive functioning this is reflected not
only in a significant decrease in patients ptsd scores but also in improved
mental clarity and an increased ability to regulate how upset they become in
response to relatively minor provocations 
21
other traumatized patients show patterns of hyperactivity the moment they
close their eyes not seeing what is going on around them makes them panic and
their brain waves go wild we train them to produce more relaxed brain patterns 
yet another group overreacts to sounds and light a sign that the thalamus has
difficulty filtering out irrelevant information in those patients we focus on
changing communication patterns at the back of the brain 
while our center is focused on finding optimal treatments for long standing
traumatic stress alexander mcfarlane is studying how exposure to combat
changes previously normal brains the australian department of defence asked
his research group to measure the effects of deployment to combat duty in iraq
and afghanistan on mental and biological functioning including brainwave
patterns in the initial phase mcfarlane and his colleagues measured the qeeg
in 179 combat troops four months prior to and four months after each successive
deployment to the middle east 
they found that the total number of months in combat over a three year
period was associated with progressive decreases in alpha power at the back of
the brain this area
 
 which monitors the state of the body and regulates such
elementary processes as sleep and hunger ordinarily has the highest level of
alpha waves of any region in the brain particularly when people close their eyes 
as we have seen alpha is associated with relaxation the decrease in alpha
power in these soldiers reflects a state of persistent agitation at the same time
the brain waves at the front of the brain which normally have high levels of
beta show a progressive slowing with each deployment the soldiers gradually
develop frontal lobe activity that resembles that of children with adhd which
interferes with their executive functioning and capacity for focused attention 
the net effect is that arousal which is supposed to provide us with the
energy needed to engage in day to day tasks no longer helps these soldiers to
focus on ordinary tasks it simply makes them agitated and restless at this stage
of mcfarlane s study it is too early to know if any of these soldiers will develop
ptsd and only time will tell to what degree these brains will readjust to the
pace of civilian life 

neurofeedback and learning disabilities
chronic abuse and neglect in childhood interfere with the proper wiring of
sensory integration systems in some cases this results in learning disabilities 
which include faulty connections between the auditory and word processing
systems and poor hand eye coordination as long as they are frozen or
explosive it is difficult to see how much trouble the adolescents in our
residential treatment programs have processing day to day information but once
their behavioral problems have been successfully treated their learning
disabilities often become manifest even if these traumatized kids could sit still
and pay attention many of them would still be handicapped by their poor
learning skills 
22
lisa described how trauma had interfered with the proper wiring of basic
processing functions she told me she always got lost going places and she
recalled having a marked auditory delay that kept her from being able to follow
the instructions from her teachers imagine being in a classroom she said 
 and the teacher comes in and says good morning turn to page two seventy 
two do problems one to five if you re even a fraction of a second off it s just a
jumble it was impossible to concentrate 
neurofeedback helped her to reverse these learning disabilities i learned to
keep track of things for example to read maps right after we started therapy 
there was this memorable time when i was going from amherst to northampton
 less than ten miles to meet sebern i was supposed to take a couple of buses 
but i ended up walking along the highway for a couple miles i was that
disorganized i couldn t read the schedule i couldn t keep track of the time i
was too jacked up and nervous which made me tired all the time i couldn t pay
attention and keep it together i just couldn t organize my brain around it 
that statement defines the challenge for brain and mind science how can
we help people learn to organize time and space distance and relationships 
capacities that are laid down in the brain during the first few years of life if
early trauma has interfered with their development neither drugs nor
conventional therapy have been shown to activate the neuroplasticity necessary
to bring those capacities online after the critical periods have passed now is the
time to study whether neurofeedback can succeed where other interventions have
failed 

alpha theta training
alpha theta training is a particularly fascinating neurofeedback procedure 
because it can induce the sorts of hypnagogic states the essence of hypnotic
trance that are discussed in chapter 15 
23
 when theta waves predominate in the
brain the mind s focus is on the internal world a world of free floating imagery 
alpha brain waves may act as a bridge from the external world to the internal 
and vice versa in alpha theta training these frequencies are alternately rewarded 
the challenge in ptsd is to open the mind to new possibilities so that the
present is no longer interpreted as a continuous reliving of the past trance
states during which theta activity dominates can help to loosen the conditioned
connections between particular stimuli and responses such as loud cracks
signaling gunfire a harbinger of death a new association can be created in
which that same crack can come to be linked to fourth of july fireworks at the
end of a day at the beach with loved ones 
in the twilight states fostered by alpha theta training traumatic events may
be safely reexperienced and new associations fostered some patients report
unusual imagery and or deep insights about their life others simply become
more relaxed and less rigid any state in which people can safely experience
images feelings and emotions that are associated with dread and helplessness is
likely to create fresh potential and a wider perspective 
can alpha theta reverse hyperarousal patterns the accumulated evidence is
promising eugene peniston and paul kulkosky researchers at the va medical
center in fort lyon colorado used neurofeedback to treat twenty nine vietnam
veterans with a twelve to fifteen year history of chronic combat related ptsd 
fifteen of the men were randomly assigned to the eeg alpha theta training and
fourteen to a control group that received standard medical care including
psychotropic drugs and individual and group therapy on average participants in
both groups had been hospitalized more than five times for their ptsd the
neurofeedback facilitated twilight states of learning by rewarding both alpha and
theta waves as the men lay back in a recliner with their eyes closed they were
coached to allow the neurofeedback sounds to guide them into deep relaxation 
they were also asked to use positive mental imagery for example being sober 
living confidently and happily as they moved toward the trancelike alpha theta
state 
this study published in 1991 had one of the best outcomes ever recorded
for ptsd the neurofeedback group had a significant decrease in their ptsd

symptoms as well as in physical complaints depression anxiety and paranoia 
after the treatment phase the veterans and their family members were contacted
monthly for a period of thirty months only three of the fifteen neurofeedback 
treated veterans reported disturbing flashbacks and nightmares all three chose
to undergo ten booster sessions only one needed to return to the hospital for
further treatment fourteen out of fifteen were using significantly less
medication 
in contrast every vet in the comparison group experienced an increase in
ptsd symptoms during the follow up period and all of them required at least
two further hospitalizations ten of the comparison group also increased their
medication use 
24
 this study has been replicated by other researchers but it has
received surprisingly little attention outside the neurofeedback community 
25
neurofeedback ptsd and addiction
approximately one third to one half of severely traumatized people develop
substance abuse problems 
26
 since the time of homer soldiers have used alcohol
to numb their pain irritability and depression in one recent study half of motor
vehicle accident victims developed problems with drugs or alcohol alcohol
abuse makes people careless and thus increases their chances of being
traumatized again although being drunk during an assault actually decreases the
likelihood of developing ptsd 
there is a circular relationship between ptsd and substance abuse while
drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from trauma symptoms 
withdrawing from them increases hyperarousal thereby intensifying nightmares 
flashbacks and irritability there are only two ways to end this vicious cycle by
resolving the symptoms of ptsd with methods such as emdr or by treating the
hyperarousal that is part of both ptsd and withdrawal from drugs or alcohol 
drugs such as naltrexone are sometimes prescribed to reduce hyperarousal but
this treatment helps in only some cases 
one of the first women i trained with neurofeedback had a long standing
cocaine addiction in addition to a horrendous childhood history of sexual abuse
and abandonment much to my surprise her cocaine habit cleared after the first
two sessions and on follow up five years later had not returned i had never seen
anyone recover this quickly from severe drug abuse so i turned to the existing
scientific literature for guidance 
27
 most of the studies on this subject were done

more than two decades ago in recent years very few neurofeedback studies for
the treatment of addiction have been published at least in the united states 
between 75 percent and 80 percent of patients who are admitted for detox
and alcohol and drug abuse treatment will relapse another study by peniston
and kulkosky on the effects of neurofeedback training with veterans who had
dual diagnoses of alcoholism and ptsd
28
 focused on this problem
 
fifteen
veterans received alpha theta training while the control group received standard
treatment without neurofeedback the subjects were followed up regularly for
three years during which eight members of neurofeedback group stopped
drinking completely and one got drunk once but became sick and didn t drink
again most of them were markedly less depressed as peniston put it the
changes reported corresponded to being more warmhearted more intelligent 
more emotionally stable more socially bold more relaxed and more satisfied 
29
in contrast all of those given standard treatment were readmitted to the hospital
within eighteen months 
30
 since that time a number of studies on neurofeedback
for addictions have been published 
31
 but this important application needs much
more research to establish its potential and limitations 
the future of neurofeedback
in my practice i use neurofeedback primarily to help with the hyperarousal 
confusion and concentration problems of people who suffer from developmental
trauma however it has also shown good results for numerous issues and
conditions that go beyond the scope of this book including relieving tension
headaches improving cognitive functioning following a traumatic brain injury 
reducing anxiety and panic attacks learning to deepen meditation states treating
autism improving seizure control self regulation in mood disorders and more 
as of 2013 neurofeedback is being used in seventeen military and va facilities
to treat ptsd 
32
 and scientific documentation of its efficacy in recent combat
vets is just beginning to be assessed frank duffy the director of the clinical
neurophysiology and developmental neurophysiology laboratories of boston
children s hospital has commented the literature which lacks any negative
study suggests that neurofeedback plays a major therapeutic role in many
different areas in my opinion if any medication had demonstrated such a wide
spectrum of efficacy it would be universally accepted and widely used 
33
many questions remain to be answered about treatment protocols for

neurofeedback but the scientific paradigm is gradually shifting in a direction
that invites a deeper exploration of these questions in 2010 thomas insel 
director of the national institute of mental health published an article in
scientific american 
entitled faulty circuits in which he called for a return to
understanding mind and brain in terms of the rhythms and patterns of electrical
communication brain regions that function together to carry out normal and
abnormal mental operations can be thought of as analogous to electrical circuits
 the latest research shows that the malfunctioning of entire circuits may
underlie many mental disorders 
34
 three years later insel announced that nimh
was re orienting its research away from dsm categories 
35
 and focusing
instead on disorders of the human connectome 
36
as explained by francis collins director of the national institutes of health
 of which nimh is a part the connectome refers to the exquisitely
interconnected network of neurons nerve cells in your brain like the genome 
the microbiome and other exciting ome fields the effort to map the
connectome and decipher the electrical signals that zap through it to generate
your thoughts feelings and behaviors has become possible through
development of powerful new tools and technologies 
37
 the connectome is now
being mapped in detail under the auspices of nimh 
as we await the results of this research i d like to give the last word to lisa 
the survivor who introduced me to the enormous potential of neurofeedback 
when i asked her to summarize what the treatment had done for her she said it
calmed me down it stopped the dissociation i can use my feelings i m not
running away from them i m not held hostage by them i can t turn them off and
on but i can put them away i may be sad about the abuse i went through but i
can put it away i can call a friend and not talk about it if i don t want to talk
about it
 
 or i can do homework or clean my apartment emotions mean
something now i m not anxious all the time and when i am anxious i can
reflect on it if the anxiety s coming from the past i can find it there or i can
look at how it relates to my life now and it s not just negative emotions like
anger and anxiety i can reflect on love and intimacy or sexual attraction i m
not in fight or flight all the time my blood pressure is down i m not physically
prepared to take off at any moment or defend myself against an attack 
neurofeedback made it possible for me to have a relationship neurofeedback
freed me up to live my life the way i want to because i m not always in the
thrall of how i was hurt and what it did to me 
four years after i met her and recorded our conversations lisa graduated

near the top of her nursing school class and she now works full time as a nurse
at a local hospital

chapter 20
finding your voice communal
rhythms and theater
acting is not about putting on a character but discovering the character
within you you are the character you just have to find it within
yourself albeit a very expanded version of yourself 
 tina packer
any scientists i know were inspired by their children s health problems to
find new ways of understanding mind brain and therapy my own son s
recovery from a mysterious illness that for lack of a better name we call chronic
fatigue syndrome convinced me of the therapeutic possibilities of theater 
nick spent most of seventh and eighth grade in bed bloated by allergies and
medications that left him too exhausted to go to school his mother and i saw
him becoming entrenched in his identity as a self hating and isolated kid and we
were desperate to help him when his mother realized that he picked up a little
energy round 5 00 p m we signed him up for an evening class in
improvisational theater where he would at least have a chance to interact with
other boys and girls his age he took to the group and to the acting exercises and
soon landed his first role as action in 
west side story 
a tough kid who s always
ready to fight and has the lead in singing gee officer krupke one day at
home i caught him walking with a swagger practicing what it was like to be
somebody with clout was he developing a physical sense of pleasure imagining
himself as a strong guy who commands respect 
then he was cast as the fonz in 
happy days 
 being adored by girls and

keeping an audience spellbound became the real tipping point in his recovery 
unlike his experience with the numerous therapists who had talked with him
about how bad he felt theater gave him a chance to deeply and physically
experience what it was like to be someone other than the learning disabled 
oversensitive boy that he had gradually become being a valued contributor to a
group gave him a visceral experience of power and competence i believe that
this new embodied version of himself set him on the road to becoming the
creative loving adult he is today 
our sense of agency how much we feel in control is defined by our
relationship with our bodies and its rhythms our waking and sleeping and how
we eat sit and walk define the contours of our days in order to find our voice 
we have to be 
in
 our bodies able to breathe fully and able to access our inner
sensations this is the opposite of dissociation of being out of body and
making yourself disappear it s also the opposite of depression lying slumped in
front of a screen that provides passive entertainment acting is an experience of
using your body to take your place in life 
the theater of war
nick s transformation was not the first time i d witnessed the benefits of theater 
in 1988 i was still treating three veterans with ptsd whom i d met at the va 
and when they showed a sudden improvement in their vitality optimism and
family relationships i attributed it to my growing therapeutic skills then i
discovered that all three were involved in a theatrical production 
wanting to dramatize the plight of homeless veterans they had persuaded
playwright david mamet who was living nearby to meet weekly with their
group to develop a script around their experiences mamet then recruited al
pacino donald sutherland and michael j fox to come to boston for an evening
called 
sketches of war
 which raised money to convert the va clinic where i d
met my patients into a shelter for homeless veterans 
1
 standing on a stage with
professional actors speaking about their memories of the war and reading their
poetry was clearly a more transformative experience than any therapy could
have offered them 
since time immemorial human beings have used communal rituals to cope
with their most powerful and terrifying feelings ancient greek theater the
oldest of which we have written records seems to have grown out of religious

rites that involved dancing singing and reenacting mythical stories by the fifth
century bce theater played a central role in civic life with the audience seated
in a horseshoe around the stage which enabled them to see one another s
emotions and reactions 
greek drama may have served as a ritual reintegration for combat veterans 
at the time aeschylus wrote the 
oresteia 
trilogy athens was at war on six
fronts the cycle of tragedy is set in motion when the returning warrior king
agamemnon is murdered by his wife clytemnestra for having sacrificed their
daughter before sailing to the trojan war military service was required of every
adult citizen of athens so audiences were undoubtedly composed of combat
veterans and active duty soldiers on leave the performers themselves must have
been citizen soldiers 
sophocles was a general officer in athens s wars against the persians and
his play 
ajax
 which ends with the suicide of one of the trojan war s greatest
heroes reads like a textbook description of traumatic stress in 2008 writer and
director bryan doerries arranged a reading of 
ajax
 for five hundred marines in
san diego and was stunned by the reception it received like many of us who
work with trauma doerries s inspiration was personal he had studied classics in
college and turned to the greek texts for comfort when he lost a girlfriend to
cystic fibrosis his project the theater of war evolved from that first event 
and with funding from the u s department of defense this 2 500 year old play
has since been performed more than two hundred times here and abroad to give
voice to the plight of combat veterans and foster dialogue and understanding in
their families and friends 
2
theater of war performances are followed by a town hall style discussion i
attended a reading of 
ajax
 in cambridge massachusetts shortly after the news
media had publicized a 27 percent increase in suicides among combat veterans
over the previous three years some forty people vietnam veterans military
wives recently discharged men and women who had served in iraq and
afghanistan lined up behind the microphone many of them quoted lines from
the play as they spoke about their sleepless nights drug addiction and alienation
from their families the atmosphere was electric and afterward the audience
huddled in the foyer some holding each other and crying others in deep
conversation 
as doerries later said anyone who has come into contact with extreme
pain suffering or death has no trouble understanding greek drama it s all about
bearing witness to the stories of veterans

keeping together in time
collective movement and music create a larger context for our lives a meaning
beyond our individual fate religious rituals universally involve rhythmic
movements from davening at the wailing wall in jerusalem to the sung liturgy
and gestures of the catholic mass to moving meditation in buddhist ceremonies
and the rhythmic prayer rituals performed five times a day by devout muslims 
music was a backbone of the civil rights movement in the united states 
anyone alive at that time will not forget the lines of marchers arms linked 
singing we shall overcome as they walked steadily toward the police who
were massed to stop them music binds together people who might individually
be terrified but who collectively become powerful advocates for themselves and
others along with language dancing marching and singing are uniquely
human ways to install a sense of hope and courage 
i observed the force of communal rhythms in action when i watched
archbishop desmond tutu conduct public hearings for the truth and
reconciliation commission in south africa in 1996 these events were framed
by collective singing and dancing witnesses recounted the unspeakable
atrocities that had been inflicted on them and their families when they became
overwhelmed tutu would interrupt their testimony and lead the entire audience
in prayer song and dance until the witnesses could contain their sobbing and
halt their physical collapse this enabled participants to pendulate in and out of
reliving their horror and eventually to find words to describe what had happened
to them i fully credit tutu and the other member of the commission with
averting what might have been an orgy of revenge as is so common when
victims are finally set free 
a few years ago i discovered 
keeping together in time

 written by the
great historian william h mcneill near the end of his career this short book
examines the historical role of dance and military drill in creating what mcneill
calls muscular bonding and sheds a new light on the importance of theater 
communal dance and movement it also solved a long standing puzzle in my
own mind having been raised in the netherlands i had always wondered how a
group of simple dutch peasants and fishermen had won their liberation from the
mighty spanish empire the eighty years war which lasted from the late
sixteenth to the midseventeenth century began as a series of guerrilla actions 
and it seemed destined to remain that way since the ill disciplined ill paid
soldiers regularly fled under volleys of musket fire 

this changed when prince maurice of orange became the leader of the
dutch rebels still in his early twenties he had recently completed his schooling
in latin which enabled him to read 1 500 year old roman manuals on military
tactics he learned that the roman general lycurgus had introduced marching in
step to the roman legions and that the historian plutarch had attributed their
invincibility to this practice it was at once a magnificent and terrible sight to
see them march on to the tune of their flutes without any disorder in their ranks 
any discomposure in their minds or change in their countenances calmly and
cheerfully moving with music to the deadly fight 
5
prince maurice instituted close order drill accompanied by drums flutes 
and trumpets in his ragtag army this collective ritual not only provided his men
with a sense of purpose and solidarity but also made it possible for them to
execute complicated maneuvers close order drill subsequently spread across
europe and to this day the major services of the u s military spend liberally on
their marching bands even though fifes and drums no longer accompany troops
into battle 
neuroscientist jaak panksepp who was born in the tiny baltic country of
estonia told me the remarkable story of estonia s singing revolution in june
1987 on one of those endless sub arctic summer evenings more than ten
thousand concertgoers at the tallinn song festival grounds linked hands and
began to sing patriotic songs that had been forbidden during half a century of
soviet occupation these songfests and protests continued and on september 11 
1988 three hundred thousand people about a quarter of the population of
estonia gathered to sing and make a public demand for independence by
august 1991 the congress of estonia had proclaimed the restoration of the
estonian state and when soviet tanks attempted to intervene people acted as
human shields to protect tallinn s radio and tv stations as a columnist noted in
the 
new york times
 imagine the scene in 
casablanca
 in which the french
patrons sing la marseillaise in defiance of the germans then multiply its
power by a factor of thousands and you ve only begun to imagine the force of
the singing revolution

treating trauma through theater
it is surprising how little research exists on how collective ceremonies affect the
mind and brain and how they might prevent or alleviate trauma over the past

decade however i have had a chance to observe and study three different
programs for treating trauma through theater urban improv in boston
7
 and the
trauma drama program it inspired in the boston public schools and in our
residential centers 
8
 the possibility project directed by paul griffin in new york
city 
9
 and shakespeare company in lenox massachusetts which runs a
program for juvenile offenders called shakespeare in the courts 
10
 in this
chapter i ll focus on these three groups but there are many excellent therapeutic
drama programs in the united states and abroad making theater a widely
available resource for recovery 
despite their differences all of these programs share a common foundation 
confrontation of the painful realities of life and symbolic transformation through
communal action love and hate aggression and surrender loyalty and betrayal
are the stuff of theater and the stuff of trauma as a culture we are trained to cut
ourselves off from the truth of what we re feeling in the words of tina packer 
the charismatic founder of shakespeare company training actors involves
training people to go against that tendency not only to feel deeply but to
convey that feeling at every moment to the audience so the audience will get it
 and not close off against it 
traumatized people are terrified to feel deeply they are afraid to experience
their emotions because emotions lead to loss of control in contrast theater is
about embodying emotions giving voice to them becoming rhythmically
engaged taking on and embodying different roles 
as we ve seen the essence of trauma is feeling godforsaken cut off from
the human race theater involves a collective confrontation with the realities of
the human condition as paul griffin discussing his theater program for foster 
care children told me the stuff of tragedy in theater revolves around coping
with betrayal assault and destruction these kids have no trouble understanding
what lear othello macbeth or hamlet are all about in tina packer s words 
 everything is about using the whole body and having other bodies resonate
with your feelings emotions and thoughts theater gives trauma survivors a
chance to connect with one another by deeply experiencing their common
humanity 
traumatized people are afraid of conflict they fear losing control and
ending up on the losing side once again conflict is central to theater inner
conflicts interpersonal conflicts family conflicts social conflicts and their
consequences trauma is about trying to forget hiding how scared enraged or
helpless you are theater is about finding ways of telling the truth and conveying

deep truths to your audience this requires pushing through blockages to
discover your own truth exploring and examining your own internal experience
so that it can emerge in your voice and body on stage 
making it safe to engage
these theater programs are not for aspiring actors but for angry frightened and
obstreperous teenagers or withdrawn alcoholic burned out veterans when they
come to rehearsal they slump into their chairs fearful that others will
immediately see what failures they are traumatized adolescents are a jumble 
inhibited out of tune inarticulate uncoordinated and purposeless they are too
hyperaroused to notice what is going on around them they are easily triggered
and rely on action rather than words to discharge their feelings 
all the directors i ve worked with agree that the secret is to go slow and
engage them bit by bit the initial challenge is simply to get participants to be
more present in the room here s kevin coleman director of shakespeare in the
courts describing his work with teens when i interviewed him first we get
them up and walking around the room then we start to create a balance in the
space so they re not walking aimlessly but become aware of other people 
gradually with little prompts it becomes more complex just walk on your toes 
or on your heels or walk backwards then when you bump into someone 
scream and fall down after maybe thirty prompts they re out there waving their
arms in the air and we get to a full body warm up but it s incremental if you
take too big a jump you ll see them hit the wall 
 you have to make it safe for them to notice each other once their bodies
are a little more free i might use the prompt don t make eye contact with
anyone just look at the floor most of them are thinking great i m doing that
already but then i say now begin to notice people as you go by but don t let
them see you looking and next just make eye contact for a second then 
 now no eye contact now contact now no contact now make eye
contact and 
hold
 it too long you ll know when it s too long because you ll
either want to start dating that person or to have a fight with them that s when
it s too long 
 they don t make that kind of extended eye contact in their normal lives 
not even with a person they re talking to they don t know if that person is safe
or not so what you re doing is making it safe for them not to disappear when
they make eye contact or when someone looks at them bit by bit by bit by

bit 
traumatized adolescents are noticeably out of sync in the trauma center s
trauma drama program we use mirroring exercises to help them to get in tune
with one another they move their right arm up and their partner mirrors it they
twirl and their partner twirls in response they begin to observe how body
movements and facial expressions change how their own natural movements
differ from those of others and how unaccustomed movements and expressions
make them feel mirroring loosens their preoccupation with what other people
think of them and helps them attune viscerally not cognitively to someone else s
experience when mirroring ends in giggles it s a sure indication that our
participants feel safe 
in order to become real partners they also need to learn to trust one another 
an exercise in which one person is blindfolded while his partner leads him by
the hand is especially tough for our kids it s often as terrifying for them to be
the leader to be trusted by someone vulnerable as it is to be blindfolded and led 
at first they may last for only ten or twenty seconds but we gradually work
them up to five minutes afterward some of them have to go off by themselves
for a while because it is so emotionally overwhelming to feel these connections 
the traumatized kids and veterans we work with are embarrassed to be seen 
afraid to be in touch with what they are feeling and they keep one another at
arm s length the job of any director like that of any therapist is to slow things
down so the actors can establish a relationship with themselves with their
bodies theater offers a unique way to access a full range of emotions and
physical sensations that not only put them in touch with the habitual set of
their bodies but also let them explore alternative ways of engaging with life 
urban improv
my son loved his theater group which was run by urban improv ui a long 
standing boston arts institution he stayed with them through high school and
then volunteered to work with them the summer after his freshman year in
college it was then that he learned that ui s violence prevention program which
has run hundreds of workshops in local schools since 1992 had received a
research grant to assess its efficacy and that they were looking for someone to
head the study nick suggested to the directors kippy dewey and cissa
campion that his dad would be the ideal person for the job luckily for me they
agreed 

i began to visit schools with ui s multicultural ensemble which included a
director four professional actor educators and a musician urban improv creates
scripted skits depicting the kinds of problems that students face every day 
exclusion from peer groups jealousy rivalry and anger and family strife skits
for older students also address issues like dating stds homophobia and peer
violence in a typical presentation the professional actors might portray a group
of kids excluding a newcomer from a lunch table in the cafeteria as the scene
approaches a choice point for example the new student responds to their put 
downs the director freezes the action a member of the class is then invited to
replace one of the actors and show how he or she would feel and behave in this
situation these scenarios enable the students to observe day to day problems
with some emotional distance while experimenting with various solutions will
they confront the tormenters talk to a friend call the homeroom teacher tell
their parents what happened 
another volunteer is then asked to try a different approach so that students
can see how other choices might play out props and costumes help the
participants take risks in new roles as do the playful atmosphere and the support
from the actors in the discussion groups afterward students respond to questions
like how was this scene similar or different from what happens in your
school how do you get the respect that you need and how do you settle
your differences these discussions become lively exchanges as many students
volunteer their thoughts and ideas 
our trauma center team evaluated this program at two grade levels in
seventeen participating schools classrooms that participated in the ui program
were compared with similar nonparticipating classrooms at the fourth grade
level we found a significant positive response on standardized rating scales for
aggression cooperation and self control students in the ui group showed
substantially fewer fights and angry outbursts more cooperation and self 
assertion with peers and more attentiveness and engagement in the classroom 
11
much to our surprise these results were not matched by the eighth graders 
what had happened in the interim that affected their responses at first we had
only our personal impressions to go on when i d visited the fourth grade
classes i d been struck by their wide eyed innocence and their eagerness to
participate the eighth graders in contrast were often sullen and defensive and
as a group seemed to have lost their spontaneity and enthusiasm onset of
puberty was one obvious factor for the change but might there be others 
when we delved further we found that the older children had experienced

more than twice as much trauma as the younger ones every single eighth grader
in these typical american inner city schools had witnessed serious violence 
two thirds had observed five or more incidents including stabbings gunfights 
killings and domestic assaults our data showed that eighth graders with such
high levels of exposure to violence were significantly more aggressive than
students without these histories and that the program made no significant
difference in their behavior 
the trauma center team decided to see if we could turn this situation
around with a longer and more intensive program that focused on team building
and emotion regulation exercises using scripts that dealt directly with the kinds
of violence these kids experienced for several months members of our staff led
by joseph spinazzola met weekly with the ui actors to work on script
development the actors taught our psychologists improvisation mirroring and
precise physical attunement so they could credibly portray melting down 
confronting cowering or collapsing we taught the actors about trauma triggers
and how to recognize and deal with trauma reenactments 
12
during the winter and spring of 2005 we tested the resulting program at a
specialized day school run jointly by the boston public schools and the
massachusetts department of correction this was a chaotic environment in
which students often shuttled back and forth between school and jail all of them
came from high crime neighborhoods and had been exposed to horrendous
violence i had never seen such an aggressive and sullen group of kids we got a
glimpse into the lives of the innumerable middle school and high school teachers
who deal daily with students whose first response to new challenges is to lash
out or go into defiant withdrawal 
we were shocked to discover that in scenes where someone was in physical
danger the students always sided with the aggressors because they could not
tolerate any sign of weakness in themselves they could not accept it in others 
they showed nothing but contempt for potential victims yelling things like 
 kill the bitch she deserves it during a skit about dating violence 
at first some of the professional actors wanted to give up it was simply
too painful to see how mean these kids were but they stuck it out and i was
amazed to see how they gradually got the students to experiment however
reluctantly with new roles toward the end of the program a few students were
even volunteering for parts that involved showing vulnerability or fear when
they received their certificate of completion several shyly gave the actors
drawings to express their appreciation i detected a few tears possibly even in

myself 
our attempt to make trauma drama a regular part of the eighth grade
curriculum in the boston public schools unfortunately ran into a wall of
bureaucratic resistance nonetheless it lives on as an integral part of the
residential treatment programs at the justice resource institute while music 
theater art and sports timeless ways of fostering competence and collective
bonding continue to disappear from our schools 
the possibility project
in paul griffin s new york city possibility project the actors are not presented
with prepared scripts instead over a nine month period they meet for three
hours a week write their own full length musical and perform it for several
hundred people during its twenty year history the possibility project has
accrued a stable staff and strong traditions each production team is made up of
recent graduates who with the help of professional actors dancers and
musicians organize scriptwriting scenic design choreography and rehearsals
for the incoming class these recent grads are powerful role models as paul
told me when they come into the program students believe they cannot make
a difference putting a program like this together is a transforming experience for
their future 
in 2010 paul started a new program specifically for foster care youth this
is a troubled population five years after maturing out of care some 60 percent
will have been convicted of a crime 75 percent will be on public assistance and
only 6 percent will have completed even a community college degree 
the trauma center treats many foster care kids but griffin gave me a new
way to see their lives understanding foster care is like learning about a foreign
country if you re not from there you don t speak the language life is upside
down for foster care youth the security and love that other children take for
granted they have to create for themselves when griffin says life is upside
down he means that if you treat kids in foster care with love or generosity they
often don t know what to make of it or how to respond rudeness feels more
familiar cynicism they understand 
as griffin points out abandonment makes it impossible to trust and kids
who have gone through foster care understand abandonment you can have no
impact until they trust you foster care children often answer to multiple people
in charge if they want to switch schools for example they have to deal with

foster parents school officials the foster care agency and sometimes a judge 
this tends to make them politically savvy and they learn all too well how to
play people 
in the foster care world permanency is a big buzzword the motto is
 one caring adult that s all you need however it is natural for teenagers to
pull away from adults and griffin remarks that the best form of permanency for
teens is a steady group of friends which the program is designed to provide 
another foster care buzzword is independence which paul counters with
 
inter
dependence we re all interdependent he points out the idea that
we re asking our young people to go out in the world completely alone and call
themselves independent is crazy we need to teach them how to be
interdependent which means teaching them how to have relationships 
paul found that foster care youth are natural actors playing tragic
characters you have to express emotions and create a reality that comes from a
place of depth and sorrow and hurt young people in foster care that s all they
know it s life and death every day for them over time collaboration helps the
kids become important people in one another s lives phase one of the program
is group building the first rehearsal establishes basic agreements responsibility 
accountability respect yes to expressions of affection no to sexual contact in
the group they then begin singing and moving together which gets them in
sync 
now comes phase two sharing life stories they are now listening to one
another discovering shared experiences breaking through the loneliness and
isolation of trauma paul gave me a film that shows how this happened in one
group when the kids are first asked to say or do something to introduce
themselves they freeze their faces expressionless their eyes cast down doing
anything they can to become invisible 
as they begin to talk as they discover a voice in which they themselves are
central they also begin to create their own show paul makes it clear the
production depends on their input if you could write a musical or play what
would you put in it punishment revenge betrayal loss this is your show
to write everything they say is written down and some of them start to put
their own words on paper as a script emerges the production team incorporates
the students precise words into the songs and dialogue the group will learn that
if they can embody their experiences well enough other people will listen they
will learn to feel what they feel and know what they know 
the focus changes naturally as rehearsals begin the foster kids history of

pain alienation and fear is no longer central and the emphasis shifts to how
can i become the best actor singer dancer choreographer or lighting and set
designer i can possibly be being able to perform becomes the critical issue 
competence is the best defense against the helplessness of trauma 
this is of course true for all of us when the job goes bad when a
cherished project fails when someone you count on leaves you or dies there are
few things as helpful as moving your muscles and doing something that demands
focused attention inner city schools and psychiatric programs often lose sight of
this they want the kids to behave normally without building the
competencies that will make them feel normal 
theater programs also teach cause and effect a foster kid s life is
completely unpredictable anything can happen without notice being triggered
and having a meltdown seeing a parent arrested or killed being moved from
one home to another getting yelled at for things that got you approval in your
last placement in a theatrical production they see the consequences of their
decisions and actions laid out directly before their eyes if you want to give
them a sense of control you have to give them power over their destiny rather
than intervene on their behalf paul explains you cannot help fix or save the
young people you are working with what you can do is work side by side with
them help them to understand their vision and realize it with them by doing
that you give them back control we re healing trauma without anyone ever
mentioning the word 
sentenced to shakespeare
for the teenagers attending sessions of shakespeare in the courts there is no
improvisation no building scripts around their own lives they are all
 adjudicated offenders found guilty of fighting drinking stealing and property
crimes and a berkshire county juvenile court judge has sentenced them to six
weeks four afternoons a week of intensive acting study shakespeare is a
foreign country for these actors as kevin coleman told me when they first turn
up angry suspicious and in shock they re convinced that they d rather go to
jail instead they re going to learn the lines of hamlet or mark antony or henry
v and then go onstage in a condensed performance of an entire shakespeare play
before an audience of family friends and representatives of the juvenile justice
system 
with no words to express the effects of their capricious upbringing these

adolescents act out their emotions with violence shakespeare calls for sword
fighting which like other martial arts gives them an opportunity to practice
contained aggression and expressions of physical power the emphasis is on
keeping everyone safe the kids love swordplay but to keep one another safe
they have to negotiate and use language 
shakespeare was writing at a time of transition when the world was moving
from primarily oral to written communication when most people were still
signing their name with an 
x
 these kids are facing their own period of
transition many are barely articulate and some struggle to read at all if they
rely on four letter words it s not only to show they re tough but because they
have no other language to communicate who they are or what they feel when
they discover the richness and the potential of language they often have a
visceral experience of joy 
the actors first investigate what exactly shakespeare is saying line by line 
the director feeds the words one by one into the actors ears and they are
instructed to say the line on the outgoing breath at the beginning of the process 
many of these kids can barely get a line out progress is slow as each actor
slowly internalizes the words the words gain depth and resonance as the voice
changes in response to their associations the idea is to inspire the actors to
sense their reactions to the words and so to discover the character rather than
 i have to remember my lines the emphasis is on what do these words mean
to 
me
 what effect do 
i
 have on my fellow actors and what happens to me
when i hear their lines 
13
this can be a life changing process as i witnessed in a workshop run by
actors trained by shakespeare company at the va medical center in bath 
new york larry a fifty nine year old vietnam veteran with twenty seven detox
hospitalizations during the previous year had volunteered to play the role of
brutus in a scene from 
julius caesar 
as the rehearsal began he mumbled and
hurried through his lines he seemed to be terrified of what people were thinking
of him 
remember march the ides of march remember 
did not great julius bleed for justice sake 
what villain touch d his body that did stab 
and not for justice 
it seemed to take hours to rehearse the speech that begins with these lines 

at first he was just standing there shoulders slumped repeating the words that
the director whispered in his ear 
remember
 what do you remember do you
remember too much or not enough 
remember
 what don t you want to
remember what is it like to remember larry s voice cracked eyes to the
floor sweat beading on his forehead 
after a short break and a sip of water back to work 
justice
 did you
receive justice did you ever bleed for justice s sake what does justice mean to
you 
struck
 have you ever struck someone have you ever been struck what
was it like what do you wish you had done 
stab
 have you ever stabbed
someone have you ever felt stabbed in the back have you stabbed someone in
the back at this point larry bolted from the room 
the next day he returned and we began again larry standing there 
perspiring heart racing having a million associations going through his mind 
gradually allowing himself to feel every word and learning to own the lines that
he uttered 
at the end of the program larry started his first job in seven years and he
was still working the last i heard six months later learning to experience and
tolerate deep emotions is essential for recovery from trauma 
 
in shakespeare in the courts the specificity of the language that is used in
rehearsal extends to the students offstage speech kevin coleman notes that
their talk is riddled with the expression i feel like he goes on if you are
confusing your emotional experiences with your judgments your work becomes
vague if you ask them how did that feel they ll immediately say it felt
good or that felt bad both of those are judgments so we never say how did
that feel at the end of a scene because it invites them to go to the judgment
part of their brain 
instead coleman asks did you notice any specific feelings that came up
for you doing that scene that way they learn to name emotional experiences 
 i felt angry when he said that i felt scared when he looked at me becoming
embodied and for lack of a better word en languaged helps the actors realize
that they have many different emotions the more they notice the more curious
they get 
when rehearsals begin the kids have to learn to stand up straight and walk
across a stage unselfconsciously they have to learn to speak so that they can be

heard in all parts of the theater which in itself presents a huge challenge the
final performance means facing the community the kids step out onto the stage 
experiencing another level of vulnerability danger or safety and they find out
how much they can trust themselves gradually the eagerness to succeed to
show that they can do it takes over kevin told me the story of a girl who played
ophelia in hamlet on the day of the performance he saw her waiting backstage 
ready to go on with a wastebasket clutched to her belly she explained that she
was so nervous she was scared she d throw up she had been a chronic runaway
from her foster homes and also from shakespeare in the courts because the
program is committed to not throwing kids out if at all possible the police and
truant officers had repeatedly brought her back there must have come a point
when she began to realize that her role was essential to the group or perhaps she
sensed the intrinsic value of the experience for herself at least for that day she
was choosing not to run 
therapy and theater
i once heard tina packer declare to a roomful of trauma specialists therapy
and theater are intuition at work they are the opposite of research where one
strives to step outside of one s own personal experience even outside your
patients experience to test the objective validity of assumptions what makes
therapy effective is deep subjective resonance and that deep sense of truth and
veracity that lives in the body i am still hoping that someday we will prove
tina wrong and combine the rigor of scientific methods with the power of
embodied intuition 
edward one of the shakespeare company teachers told me about an
experience he d had as a young actor in packer s advanced training workshop 
the group had spent the morning doing exercises aimed at getting the muscles of
the torso to release so that the breath could drop in naturally and fully edward
noticed that every time he rolled through one section of his ribs he d feel a wave
of sadness the coach asked if he d ever been injured there and he said no 
for packer s afternoon class he d prepared a speech from 
richard ii 
where
the king is summoned to give up his crown to the lord who has usurped him 
during the discussion afterward he recalled that his mother had broken her ribs
when she was pregnant with him and that he d always associated this with his
premature birth 
as he recalled 

when i told tina this she started asking me questions about my first
few months i said i didn t remember being in an incubator but that i
remembered times later when i stopped breathing and being in the
hospital in an oxygen tent i remembered being in my uncle s car and
him driving through red lights to get me to the emergency room it was
like having sudden infant death syndrome at the age of three 
tina kept asking me questions and i started to get really frustrated
and angry at her poking away at whatever shield i had around that pain 
then she said was it painful when the doctors stuck all those needles
in you 
at that moment i just started screaming i tried to leave the room 
but two of the other actors really big guys held me down they
finally got me to sit in a chair and i was trembling and shaking then
tina said you re your mother and you re going to do this speech 
you re your mother and you re giving birth to yourself and you re
telling yourself that you re going to make it you re not going to die 
you must convince yourself you must convince that little newborn that
you re not going to die 
this became my intention with richard s speech when i first
brought the speech to class i told myself that i wanted to get the role
right not that something welling deep inside me needed to say these
words when finally it did it became so clear that my baby was like
richard i was not ready to give up my throne it was like megatons of
energy and tension just left my body pathways opened up for
expression that had been blocked by this baby holding his breath and
being so afraid that it was going to die 
the genius of tina was in having me become my mother telling me
i d be okay it was almost like going back and changing the story being
reassured that someday i would feel safe enough to express my pain
made it a precious part of my life 
that night i had the first orgasm i d ever had in the presence of
another person and i know it s because i released something some
tension in my body that allowed me to be more in the world 

w
epilogue
choices to be made
e are on the verge of becoming a trauma conscious society almost every
day one of my colleagues publishes another report on how trauma
disrupts the workings of mind brain and body the ace study showed how
early abuse devastates health and social functioning while james heckman won
a nobel prize for demonstrating the vast savings produced by early intervention
in the lives of children from poor and troubled families more high school
graduations less criminality increased employment and decreased family and
community violence all over the world i meet people who take these data
seriously and who work tirelessly to develop and apply more effective
interventions whether devoted teachers social workers doctors therapists 
nurses philanthropists theater directors prison guards police officers or
meditation coaches if you have come this far with me in 
the body ke
e
ps the
score
 you have also become part of this community 
advances in neuroscience have given us a better understanding of how
trauma changes brain development self regulation and the capacity to stay
focused and in tune with others sophisticated imaging techniques have
identified the origins of ptsd in the brain so that we now understand why
traumatized people become disengaged why they are bothered by sounds and
lights and why they may blow up or withdraw in response to the slightest
provocation we have learned how throughout life experiences change the
structure and function of the brain and even affect the genes we pass on to our
children understanding many of the fundamental processes that underlie
traumatic stress opens the door to an array of interventions that can bring the
brain areas related to self regulation self perception and attention back online 
we know not only how to treat trauma but also increasingly how to prevent it 

and yet after attending another wake for a teenager who was killed in a
drive by shooting in the blue hill avenue section of boston or after reading
about the latest school budget cuts in impoverished cities and towns i find
myself close to despair in many ways we seem to be regressing with measures
like the callous congressional elimination of food stamps for kids whose parents
are unemployed or in jail with the stubborn opposition to universal health care
in some quarters with psychiatry s obtuse refusal to make connection between
psychic suffering and social conditions with the refusal to prohibit the sale or
possession of weapons whose only purpose is to kill large numbers of human
beings and with our tolerance for incarcerating a huge segment of our
population wasting their lives as well as our resources 
discussions of ptsd still tend to focus on recently returned soldiers 
victims of terrorist bombings or survivors of terrible accidents but trauma
remains a much larger public health issue arguably the greatest threat to our
national well being since 2001 far more americans have died at the hands of
their partners or other family members than in the wars in iraq and afghanistan 
american women are twice as likely to suffer domestic violence as breast cancer 
the american academy of pediatrics estimates that firearms kill twice as many
children as cancer does all around boston i see signs advertising the jimmy
fund which fights children s cancer and for marches to fund research on breast
cancer and leukemia but we seem too embarrassed or discouraged to mount a
massive effort to help children and adults learn to deal with the fear rage and
collapse the predictable consequences of having been traumatized 
when i give presentations on trauma and trauma treatment participants
sometimes ask me to leave out the politics and confine myself to talking about
neuroscience and therapy i wish i could separate trauma from politics but as
long as we continue to live in denial and treat only trauma while ignoring its
origins we are bound to fail in today s world your zip code even more than
your genetic code determines whether you will lead a safe and healthy life 
people s income family structure housing employment and educational
opportunities affect not only their risk of developing traumatic stress but also
their access to effective help to address it poverty unemployment inferior
schools social isolation widespread availability of guns and substandard
housing all are breeding grounds for trauma trauma breeds further trauma hurt
people hurt other people 
my most profound experience with healing from collective trauma was
witnessing the work of the south african truth and reconciliation commission 

which was based on the central guiding principle of 
ubuntu
 a xhosa word that
denotes sharing what you have as in my humanity is inextricably bound up in
yours ubuntu recognizes that true healing is impossible without recognition of
our common humanity and our common destiny 
we are fundamentally social creatures our brains are wired to foster
working and playing together trauma devastates the social engagement system
and interferes with cooperation nurturing and the ability to function as a
productive member of the clan in this book we have seen how many mental
health problems from drug addiction to self injurious behavior start off as
attempts to cope with emotions that became unbearable because of a lack of
adequate human contact and support yet institutions that deal with traumatized
children and adults all too often bypass the emotional engagement system that is
the foundation of who we are and instead focus narrowly on correcting faulty
thinking and on suppressing unpleasant emotions and troublesome behaviors 
people can learn to control and change their behavior but only if they feel
safe enough to experiment with new solutions the body keeps the score if
trauma is encoded in heartbreaking and gut wrenching sensations then our first
priority is to help people move out of fight or flight states reorganize their
perception of danger and manage relationships where traumatized children are
concerned the last things we should be cutting from school schedules are the
activities that can do precisely that chorus physical education recess and
anything else that involves movement play and other forms of joyful
engagement 
as we ve seen my own profession often compounds rather than alleviates 
the problem many psychiatrists today work in assembly line offices where they
see patients they hardly know for fifteen minutes and then dole out pills to
relieve pain anxiety or depression their message seems to be leave it to us to
fix you just be compliant and take these drugs and come back in three months 
but be sure not to use alcohol or illegal drugs to relieve your problems such
shortcuts in treatment make it impossible to develop self care and self 
leadership one tragic example of this orientation is the rampant prescription of
painkillers which now kill more people each year in the united states than guns
or car accidents 
our increasing use of drugs to treat these conditions doesn t address the real
issues what are these patients trying to cope with what are their internal or
external resources how do they calm themselves down do they have caring
relationships with their bodies and what do they do to cultivate a physical sense

of power vitality and relaxation do they have dynamic interactions with other
people who really knows them loves them and cares about them whom can
they count on when they re scared when their babies are ill or when they are
sick themselves are they members of a community and do they play vital roles
in the lives of the people around them what specific skills do they need to
focus pay attention and make choices do they have a sense of purpose what
are they good at how can we help them feel in charge of their lives 
i like to believe that once our society truly focuses on the needs of children 
all forms of social support for families a policy that remains so controversial in
this country will gradually come to seem not only desirable but also doable 
what difference would it make if all american children had access to high 
quality day care where parents could safely leave their children as they went off
to work or school what would our school systems look like if all children could
attend well staffed preschools that cultivated cooperation self regulation 
perseverance and concentration as opposed to focusing on passing tests which
will likely happen once children are allowed to follow their natural curiosity and
desire to excel and are not shut down by hopelessness fear and hyperarousal 
i have a family photograph of myself as a five year old perched between
my older obviously wiser and younger obviously more dependent siblings in
the picture i proudly hold up a wooden toy boat grinning from ear to ear see
what a wonderful kid i am and see what an incredible boat i have wouldn t you
love to come and play with me all of us but especially children need such
confidence confidence that others will know affirm and cherish us without
that we can t develop a sense of agency that will enable us to assert this is
what i believe in this is what i stand for this is what i will devote myself to 
as long as we feel safely held in the hearts and minds of the people who love us 
we will climb mountains and cross deserts and stay up all night to finish
projects children and adults will do anything for people they trust and whose
opinion they value 
but if we feel abandoned worthless or invisible nothing seems to matter 
fear destroys curiosity and playfulness in order to have a healthy society we
must raise children who can safely play and learn there can be no growth
without curiosity and no adaptability without being able to explore through trial
and error who you are and what matters to you currently more than 50 percent
of the children served by head start have had three or more adverse childhood
experiences like those included in the ace study incarcerated family members 
depression violence abuse or drug use in the home or periods of homelessness 

people who feel safe and meaningfully connected with others have little
reason to squander their lives doing drugs or staring numbly at television they
don t feel compelled to stuff themselves with carbohydrates or assault their
fellow human beings however if nothing they do seems to make a difference 
they feel trapped and become susceptible to the lure of pills gang leaders 
extremist religions or violent political movements anybody and anything that
promises relief as the ace study has shown child abuse and neglect is the
single most preventable cause of mental illness the single most common cause
of drug and alcohol abuse and a significant contributor to leading causes of
death such as diabetes heart disease cancer stroke and suicide 
my colleagues and i focus much of our work where trauma has its greatest
impact on children and adolescents since we came together to establish the
national child traumatic stress network in 2001 it has grown into a
collaborative network of more than 150 centers nationwide each of which has
created programs in schools juvenile justice systems child welfare agencies
 
homeless shelters military facilities and residential group homes 
the trauma center is one of nctsn s treatment development and
evaluation sites my colleagues joe spinazzola margaret blaustein and i have
developed comprehensive programs for children and adolescents that we with
the help of trauma savvy colleagues in hartford chicago houston san
francisco anchorage los angeles and new york are now implementing our
team selects a particular area of the country to work in every two years relying
on local contacts to identify organizations that are energetic open and well
respected these will eventually serve as new nodes for treatment dissemination 
for example i collaborated for one two year period with colleagues in missoula 
montana to help develop a culturally sensitive trauma program on blackfoot
indian reservations 
the greatest hope for traumatized abused and neglected children is to
receive a good education in schools where they are seen and known where they
learn to regulate themselves and where they can develop a sense of agency at
their best schools can function as islands of safety in a chaotic world they can
teach children how their bodies and brains work and how they can understand
and deal with their emotions schools can play a significant role in instilling the
resilience necessary to deal with the traumas of neighborhoods or families if
parents are forced to work two jobs to eke out a living or if they are too
impaired overwhelmed or depressed to be attuned to the needs of their kids 
schools by default have to be the places where children are taught self leadership

and an internal locus of control 
when our team arrives at a school the teachers initial response is often
some version of if i d wanted to be a social worker i would have gone to social
work school but i came here to be a teacher many of them have already
learned the hard way however that they cannot teach if they have a classroom
filled with students whose alarm bells are constantly going off even the most
committed teachers and school systems often come to feel frustrated and
ineffective because so many of their kids are too traumatized to learn focusing
only on improving test scores won t make any difference if teachers can t
effectively address the behavior problems of these students the good news is
that the basic principles of trauma focused interventions can be translated into
practical day to day routines and approaches that can transform the entire culture
of a school 
most teachers we work with are intrigued to learn that abused and neglected
students are likely to interpret any deviation from routine as danger and that their
extreme reactions usually are expressions of traumatic stress children who defy
the rules are unlikely to be brought to reason by verbal reprimands or even
suspension a practice that has become epidemic in american schools 
teachers perspectives begin to change when they realize that these kids 
disturbing behaviors started out as frustrated attempts to communicate distress
and as misguided attempts to survive 
more than anything else being able to feel safe with other people defines
mental health safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying
lives the critical challenge in a classroom setting is to foster reciprocity truly
hearing and being heard really seeing and being seen by other people we try to
teach everyone in a school community office staff principals bus drivers 
teachers and cafeteria workers to recognize and understand the effects of
trauma on children and to focus on the importance of fostering safety 
predictability and being known and seen we make certain that the children are
greeted by name every morning and that teachers make face to face contact with
each and every one of them just as in our workshops group work and theater
programs we always start the day with check ins taking the time to share what s
on everybody s mind 
many of the children we work with have never been able to communicate
successfully with language as they are accustomed to adults who yell 
command sulk or put earbuds in their ears one of our first steps is to help their
teachers model new ways of talking about feelings stating expectations and

asking for help instead of yelling stop when a child is throwing a tantrum or
making her sit alone in the corner teachers are encouraged to notice and name
the child s experience as in i can see how upset you are to give her choices 
as in would you like to go to the safe spot or sit on my lap and to help her
find words to describe her feelings and begin to find her voice as in what will
happen when you get home after class it may take many months for a child to
know when it is safe to speak the truth because it will never be universally
safe but for children as for adults identifying the truth of an experience is
essential to healing from trauma 
it is standard practice in many schools to punish children for tantrums 
spacing out or aggressive outbursts all of which are often symptoms of
traumatic stress when that happens the school instead of offering a safe haven 
becomes yet another traumatic trigger angry confrontations and punishment can
at best temporarily halt unacceptable behaviors but since the underlying alarm
system and stress hormones are not laid to rest they are certain to erupt again at
the next provocation 
in such situations the first step is acknowledging that a child is upset then
the teacher should calm him then explore the cause and discuss possible
solutions for example when a first grader melts down hitting his teacher and
throwing objects around we encourage his teacher to set clear limits while
gently talking to him 
 
would you like to wrap that blanket around you to help
you calm down the kid is likely to scream no but then curl up under the
blanket and settle down predictability and clarity of expectations are critical 
consistency is essential children from chaotic backgrounds often have no idea
how people can effectively work together and inconsistency only promotes
further confusion trauma sensitive teachers soon realize that calling a parent
about an obstreperous kid is likely to result in a beating and further
traumatization 
our goal in all these efforts is to translate brain science into everyday
practice for example calming down enough to take charge of ourselves requires
activating the brain areas that notice our inner sensations the self observing
watchtower discussed in chapter 4 so a teacher might say shall we take some
deep breaths or use the breathing star this is a colorful breathing aid made
out of file folders another option might be having the child sit in a corner
wrapped in a heavy blanket while listening to some soothing music through
headphones safe areas can help kids calm down by providing stimulating
sensory awareness the texture of burlap or velvet shoe boxes filled with soft

brushes and flexible toys when the child is ready to talk again he is encouraged
to tell someone what is going on before he rejoins the group 
kids as young as three can blow soap bubbles and learn that when they slow
down their breathing to six breaths per minute and focus on the out breath as it
flows over their upper lip they will feel more calm and focused our team of
yoga teachers works with children nearing adolescence specifically to help them
 befriend their bodies and deal with disruptive physical sensations we know
that one of the prime reasons for habitual drug use in teens is that they cannot
stand the physical sensations that signal fear rage and helplessness 
self regulation can be taught to many kids who cycle between frantic
activity and immobility in addition to reading writing and arithmetic all kids
need to learn self awareness self regulation and communication as part of their
core curriculum just as we teach history and geography we need to teach
children how their brains and bodies work for adults and children alike being
in control of ourselves requires becoming familiar with our inner world and
accurately identifying what scares upsets or delights us 
emotional intelligence starts with labeling your own feelings and attuning to
the emotions of the people around you we begin very simply with mirrors 
looking into a mirror helps kids to be aware of what they look like when they
are sad angry bored or disappointed then we ask them how do you feel
when you see a face like that we teach them how their brains are built what
emotions are for and where they are registered in their bodies and how they can
communicate their feelings to the people around them they learn that their
facial muscles give clues about what they are feeling and then experiment with
how their facial expressions affect other people 
we also strengthen the brain s watchtower by teaching them to recognize
and name their physical sensations for example when their chest tightens that
probably means that they are nervous their breathing becomes shallow and they
feel uptight what does anger feel like and what can they do to change that
sensation in their body what happens if they take a deep breath or take time out
to jump rope or hit a punching bag does tapping acupressure points help we
try to provide children teachers and other care providers with a toolbox of ways
to take charge of their emotional reactions 
to promote reciprocity we use other mirroring exercises which are the
foundation of safe interpersonal communication kids practice imitating one
another s facial expressions they proceed to imitating gestures and sounds and
then get up and move in sync to play well they have to pay attention to really

seeing and hearing one another games like simon says lead to lots of
sniggering and giggling signs of safety and relaxation when teenagers balk at
these stupid games we nod understandingly and enlist their cooperation by
asking them to demonstrate games to the little kids who need their help 
teachers and leaders learn that an activity as simple as trying to keep a
beach ball in the air as long as possible helps groups become more focused 
cohesive and fun these are inexpensive interventions for older children some
schools have installed workstations costing less than two hundred dollars where
students can play computer games to help them focus and to improve their heart
rate variability hrv discussed in chapter 16 just as we do in our own clinic 
children and adults alike need to experience how rewarding it is to work at
the edge of their abilities resilience is the product of agency knowing that what
you do can make a difference
 
 many of us remember what playing team sports 
singing in the school choir or playing in the marching band meant to us 
especially if we had coaches or directors who believed in us pushed us to excel 
and taught us we could be better than we thought was possible the children we
reach need this experience 
athletics playing music dancing and theatrical performances all promote
agency and community they also engage kids in novel challenges and
unaccustomed roles in a devastated postindustrial new england town my
friends carolyn and eli newberger are teaching el sistema an orchestral music
program that originated in venezuela several of my students run an after school
program in brazilian 
capoeira
 in a high crime area of boston and my
colleagues at the trauma center continue the trauma drama program last year
i spent three weeks helping two boys prepare a scene from 
julius caesar
 an
effeminate shy boy was playing brutus and had to summon up his full force to
put down cassius played by the class bully who had to be coached to play a
corrupt general begging for mercy the scene came to life only after the bully
talked about his father s violence and his own vow never to show weakness to
anyone most bullies have themselves been bullied and they despise kids who
remind them of their own vulnerability brutus s powerful voice on the other
hand emerged after he realized that he d made himself invisible to deal with his
own family violence 
these intense communal efforts force kids to collaborate compromise and
stay focused on the task at hand tensions often run high but the kids stick with
it because they want to earn the respect of their coaches or directors and don t
want to let down the team all feelings that are opposite to the vulnerability of

being subjected to arbitrary abuse the invisibility of neglect and the
godforsaken isolation of trauma 
our nctsn programs are working kids become less anxious and
emotionally reactive and are less aggressive or withdrawn they get along better
and their school performance improves their attention deficit hyperactivity and
 oppositional defiant problems decrease and parents report that their children
are sleeping better terrible things still happen to them and around them but they
are now able to talk about these events they have built up the trust and resources
to seek the help they need interventions are successful if they draw on our
natural wellsprings of cooperation and on our inborn responses to safety 
reciprocity and imagination 
trauma constantly confronts us with our fragility and with man s
inhumanity to man but also with our extraordinary resilience i have been able to
do this work for so long because it drew me to explore our sources of joy 
creativity meaning and connection all the things that make life worth living i
can t begin to imagine how i would have coped with what many of my patients
have endured and i see their symptoms as part of their strength the ways they
learned to survive and despite all their suffering many have gone on to become
loving partners and parents exemplary teachers nurses scientists and artists 
most great instigators of social change have intimate personal knowledge of
trauma oprah winfrey comes to mind as do maya angelou nelson mandela 
and elie wiesel read the life history of any visionary and you will find insights
and passions that came from having dealt with devastation 
the same is true of societies many of our most profound advances grew out
of experiencing trauma the abolition of slavery from the civil war social
security in response to the great depression and the gi bill which produced
our once vast and prosperous middle class from world war ii trauma is now
our most urgent public health issue and we have the knowledge necessary to
respond effectively the choice is ours to act on what we know 

acknowledgments
this book is the fruit of thirty years of trying to understand how people deal
with survive and heal from traumatic experiences thirty years of clinical work
with traumatized men women and children innumerable discussions with
colleagues and students and participation in the evolving science about how
mind brain and body deal with and recover from overwhelming experiences 
let me start with the people who helped me organize and eventually
publish this book toni burbank my editor with whom i communicated many
times each week over a two year period about the scope organization and
specific contents of the book toni truly understood what this book is about and
that understanding has been critical in defining its form and substance my
agent brettne bloom understood the importance of this work found a home for
it with viking and provided critical support at critical moments rick kot my
editor at viking supplied invaluable feedback and editorial guidance 
my colleagues and students at the trauma center have provided the feeding
ground laboratory and support system for this work they also have been
constant reminders of the sober reality of our work for these three decades i
cannot name them all but joseph spinazzola margaret blaustein roslin moore 
richard jacobs liz warner wendy d andrea jim hopper fran grossman 
alex cook marla zucker kevin becker david emerson steve gross dana
moore robert macy liz rice smith patty levin nina murray mark gapen 
carrie pekor debbie korn and betta de boer van der kolk all have been critical
collaborators and of course andy pond and susan wayne of the justice
resource institute 
my most important companions and guides in understanding and
researching traumatic stress have been alexander mcfarlane onno van der
hart ruth lanius and paul frewen rachel yehuda stephen porges glenn
saxe jaak panksepp janet osterman julian ford brad stolback frank
putnam bruce perry judith herman robert pynoos berthold gersons ellert

nijenhuis annette streeck fisher marylene cloitre dan siegel eli newberger 
vincent felitti robert anda and martin teicher as well as my colleagues who
taught me about attachment edward tronick karlen lyons ruth and beatrice
beebe 
peter levine pat ogden and al pesso read my paper on the importance of
the body in traumatic stress back in 1994 and then offered to teach me about the
body i am still learning from them and that learning has since then been
expanded by yoga and meditation teachers stephen cope jon kabat zinn and
jack kornfield 
sebern fisher first taught me about neurofeedback ed hamlin and larry
hirshberg later expanded that understanding richard schwartz taught me
internal family systems ifs therapy and assisted in helping to write the chapter
on ifs kippy dewey and cissa campion introduced me to theater tina packer
tried to teach me how to do it and andrew borthwick leslie provided critical
details 
adam cummings amy sullivan and susan miller provided indispensible
support without which many projects in this book could never have been
accomplished 
licia sky created the environment that allowed me to concentrate on writing
this book she provided invaluable feedback on each one of the chapters she
donated her artistic gifts to many illustrations and she contributed to sections on
body awareness and clinical case material my trusty secretary angela lin took
care of multiple crises and kept the ship running at full speed ed and edith
schonberg often provided a shelter from the storm barry and lorrie goldensohn
served as literary critics and inspiration and my children hana and nicholas 
showed me that every new generation lives in a world that is radically different
from the previous one and that each life is unique a creative act by its owner
that defies explanation by genetics environment or culture alone 
finally my patients to whom i dedicate this book i wish i could mention
you all by name who taught me almost everything i know because you were
my true textbook and the affirmation of the life force which drives us human
beings to create a meaningful life regardless of the obstacles we encounter 

appendix
consensus proposed criteria for
developmental trauma disorder
the goal of introducing the diagnosis of developmental trauma disorder is to
capture the reality of the clinical presentations of children and adolescents
exposed to chronic interpersonal trauma and thereby guide clinicians to develop
and utilize effective interventions and for researchers to study the neurobiology
and transmission of chronic interpersonal violence whether or not they exhibit
symptoms of ptsd children who have developed in the context of ongoing
danger maltreatment and inadequate caregiving systems are ill served by the
current diagnostic system as it frequently leads to no diagnosis multiple
unrelated diagnoses an emphasis on behavioral control without recognition of
interpersonal trauma and lack of safety in the etiology of symptoms and a lack
of attention to ameliorating the developmental disruptions that underlie the
symptoms 
the consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder were
devised and put forward in february 2009 by a national child traumatic stress
network nctsn affiliated task force led by bessel a van der kolk md and
robert s pynoos md with the participation of dante cicchetti phd marylene
cloitre phd wendy d andrea phd julian d ford phd alicia f lieberman 
phd frank w putnam md glenn saxe md joseph spinazzola phd bradley
c stolbach phd and martin teicher md phd the consensus proposed
criteria are based on extensive review of empirical literature expert clinical
wisdom surveys of nctsn clinicians and preliminary analysis of data from
thousands of children in numerous clinical and child service system settings 
including nctsn treatment centers state child welfare systems inpatient

psychiatric settings and juvenile detention centers because their validity 
prevalence symptom thresholds or clinical utility have yet to be examined
through prospective data collection or analysis these proposed criteria should
not be viewed as a formal diagnostic category to be incorporated into the dsm
as written here rather they are intended to describe the most clinically
significant symptoms exhibited by many children and adolescents following
complex trauma these proposed criteria have guided the developmental
trauma disorder field trials that began in 2009 and continue to this day 
consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder
a exposure the child or adolescent has experienced or witnessed multiple
or prolonged adverse events over a period of at least one year beginning in
childhood or early adolescence including

or thrill seeking
c 3 maladaptive attempts at self soothing e g rocking and other
rhythmical movements compulsive masturbation 
c 4 habitual intentional or automatic or reactive self harm
c 5 inability to initiate or sustain goal directed behavior
d self and relational dysregulation the child exhibits impaired normative
developmental competencies in their sense of personal identity and
involvement in relationships including at least three of the following 
d 1 intense preoccupation with safety of the caregiver or other loved
ones including precocious caregiving or difficulty tolerating reunion
with them after separation
d 2 persistent negative sense of self including self loathing 
helplessness worthlessness ineffectiveness or defectiveness
d 3 extreme and persistent distrust defiance or lack of reciprocal
behavior in close relationships with adults or peers
d 4 reactive physical or verbal aggression toward peers caregivers or
other adults
d 5 inappropriate excessive or promiscuous attempts to get intimate
contact including but not limited to sexual or physical intimacy or
excessive reliance on peers or adults for safety and reassurance
d 6 impaired capacity to regulate empathic arousal as evidenced by
lack of empathy for or intolerance of expressions of distress of others 
or excessive responsiveness to the distress of others

as abram kardiner wrote in 1947 the subject of neurotic disturbances consequent upon war has in
the past 25 years been submitted to a good deal of capriciousness in public interest and psychiatric
whims the public does not sustain its interest which was very great after world war i and neither
does psychiatry hence these conditions are not subject to continuous study

 during the past decade two editors in chief of the most prestigious professional medical journal in the
united states the 
new england journal of medicine
 dr marcia angell and dr arnold relman have
resigned from their positions because of the excessive power of the pharmaceutical industry over
medical research hospitals and doctors in a letter to the 
new york times
 on december 28 2004 
angell and relman pointed out that the previous year one drug company had spent 28 percent of its
revenues more than 6 billion on marketing and administrative expenses while spending only half
that on research and development keeping 30 percent in net income was typical for the pharmaceutical
industry they concluded the medical profession should break its dependence on the pharmaceutical
industry and educate its own unfortunately this is about as likely as politicians breaking free from
the donors that finance their election campaigns

had been found to have secure relationships with their mothers made up some imaginative tale with a

 at this point we have little information about what factors affect the evolution of these early

even genetic factors are likely to modify them over time it is obviously critical to study to what degree

 when an adult uses a child for sexual gratification the child invariably is caught in a confusing
situation and a conflict of loyalties by disclosing the abuse she betrays and hurts the perpetrator who
may be an adult on whom the child depends for safety and protection but by hiding the abuse she
compounds her shame and vulnerability this dilemma was first articulated by s ndor ferenczi in
1933 in the confusion of tongues between the adult and the child the language of tenderness
and the language of passion

 for children who were physically abused the chance of being diagnosed with conduct disorder or
oppositional defiant disorder went up by a factor of three neglect or sexual abuse doubled the chance

of developing an anxiety disorder parental psychological unavailability or sexual abuse doubled the
chance of later developing ptsd the chance of receiving multiple diagnoses was 54 percent for
children who suffered neglect 60 percent for physical abuse and 73 percent for both sexual abuse 
24
 this was a quote based on the work of emmy werner who has studied 698 children born on the
island of kauai for forty years starting in 1955 the study showed that most children who grew up in
unstable households grew up to experience problems with delinquency mental and physical health 
and family stability one third of all high risk children displayed resilience and developed into caring 
competent and confident adults 
protective factors
 were 1 being an appealing child 2 a strong bond

 vol 7 london hogarth press 1962 190 the reappearance
of sexual activity is determined by internal causes and external contingencies i shall have to speak
presently of the internal causes 
great and lasting importance attaches at this period to the accidental
external 
 freud s emphasis 
 contingencies in the foreground we find the effects of seduction which
treats a child as a sexual object prematurely
 and teaches him in highly emotional circumstances how
to obtain satisfaction from his genital zones a satisfaction which he is then usually obliged to repeat
again and again by masturbation an influence of this kind may originate either from adults or from

other children 
i cannot admit that in my paper on the aetiology of hysteria 1896c i exaggerated
the frequency or importance of that influence 
 though i did not then know that persons who remain
normal may have had the same experiences in their childhood and though i consequently overrated the
importance of seduction in comparison with the factors of sexual constitution and development 
obviously seduction is not required in order to arouse a child s sexual life that can also come about
spontaneously from internal causes s freud introductory lectures in psychoanalysis in

 in a neuroimaging study the ptsd subjects deactivated the speech area of their brain broca s area in
response to neutral words in other words the decreased broca s area functioning that we had found in
ptsd patients see chapter 3 did not only occur in response to traumatic memories it also happened
when they were asked to pay attention to neutral words this means that as a group traumatized

patients have a harder time to articulate what they feel and think about ordinary events the ptsd
group also had decreased activation of the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc the frontal lobe area that 
as we have seen conveys awareness of one s self and dampens activation of the amygdala the smoke
detector this made it harder for them to suppress the brain s fear response in response to a simple
language task and again made it harder to pay attention and go on with their lives see moores k a

 in chapter 17 we saw how essential it is to cultivate a state of steady calm self observation which
ifs calls a state of being in self dick schwartz claims that with persistence anybody can achieve
such a state and indeed i have seen him help very traumatized people do precisely that i am not that
skilled and many of my most severely traumatized patients become frantic or spaced out when we
approach upsetting subjects others feel so chronically out of control that it is difficult to find any
abiding sense of self in most psychiatric settings people with these problems are given medications
to stabilize them sometimes that works but many patients lose their motivation and drive in our
randomized controlled study of neurofeedback chronically traumatized patients had an approximately
30 percent reduction in ptsd symptoms and a significant improvement in measures of executive
function and emotional control van der kolk et al submitted 2014
